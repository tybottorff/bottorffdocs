# 9/14/23 Peter SI talk: self-reactive germline-like TCRα chains shared between blood and pancreas
## Summary
 - TCR chains from islet antigen reactive (IAR) CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in blood also in pancreas (or at least relatives)
 - pancreas infiltrate T cells (PIT) α chains are similar to IAR TCRs
 - model peptide contacts by PIT-matching IAR TCRs
## Background
 - TCRα only have VJ recombination, TCRβ has VDJ
 - CDR1-3: complementarity determining regions, CDR1-2 in germline and determine MHC specificity, CDR3 semi-random, CDR1/3 (and 2β) determine peptide specificity
 - healthy control subjects often also have IAR T cells in blood (perhaps just lower frequency/different phenotype), **perhaps a consequence of crossreactivity?**
 - IAR t cells are very rare, how do they affect disease?
 - goal: compare IAR and PIT T cells for TCR junction overlap
 - cross reactivity refers to ability of TCRs to bind multiple epitopes and still initiate cellular response (required for a comprehensive immune system as the number of potential foreign peptide-MHC complexes >> number of αβ TCR receptors but also opens door for autoimmune disease)
 - β might determine TCR specificity more in some contexts (like influenza)
 - HLA-DRA is invariant, HLA-DRB more polymorphic
## Results
 - ~35% of IAR TCRα match PIT, ~19% of PIT match IAR
 - overlap more with public not private junction (expected)
 - matches have shorter junctions (CRD1/3 not CRD2), more germline-like, less random DNA added
 - α junctions more similar than β ones
# Erin geneal notes
 - more likely for cell to have 2 alpha (maybe real) than 2 betas (doublet)
 - no nt deletions just additions in TCR generation
 - some autoreactivity good to tone down excessive immune responses from self
