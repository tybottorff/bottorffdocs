# Accumulation of identical T cells in melanoma and vitiligo-like leukoderma
 - numbers of T cells in small skin samples often insufficient for clonality analysis
 - **perhaps only well-expressed self proteins are efficient in inducing tolerance, so rare self proteins can induce autoreactivity?**
# Activation of human T cells by major histocompatability complex class II expressing neutrophils: proliferation in the presence of superantigen, but not tetanus toxoid
 - polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) function for acute phagocytic clearance of foreign pathogens, release inflammatory mediators, assumed to not express but can express MHC class II molecules after stimulation by interferon γ
 - superantigen refers to antigen binding to MHC class II with high affinity outside antigen binding groove in absence of antigen processing, trigger proliferation of T cells expressing TcR-VB gene products (stimulate T cells in TCR Vβ-specific manner)
# Adoptive T cell therapy targeting Epstein-Barr virus as a treatment for multiple sclerosis
 - there's a causative link between EBV and MS, want to target EBV-infected B cells (EBV transforms B cells for life upon infection)
# Advances in immune checkpoint inhibitor combination strategies for microsatellite stable colorectal cancer
 - microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal tumors are immune-cold
# Aging-associated and CD4 T cell-dependent ectopic CXCL13 activation predisposes to anti-PD-1 therapy-induced adverse events
 - mice
 - ectopic accumulation of T and B cells in damaged organs only in aged mice
 - CD4 T cell-derived IL-21 upregulated CXCL13 (B cell homing chemokine) in irAE organs in aged mice with ICB
# Allopeptides and the alloimmune response
 - allorecognition is recognition of non-self
 - main targets of recipient immune response against allograft are donor MHC antigens on allogenic tissue
 - recognition of mismatched MHC antigens leads to allograft rejection
 - allorecognition can occur directly and/or indirectly: directly refers to recognition of intact donor MHC molecules on donor cells (APC)s, indirectly refers to presentation of processed antigens by recipient APCs to recipient T cells
# Amino acid similarity accounts for T cell crossreactivity and for "holes" in the T cell repertoire
 - analyze HIV epitope SLFNTVATL (SFL9)
 - biochemically similar amino acid substitutions in peptide don't drastically alter TCR-pMHC recognition
 - crossreactive TCRs target peptides with similar biochemistry despite potentially dissimilar sequence
 - estimate TCRs to be able to bind ~10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> peptides
 - **around half of foreign pMHCs don't induce T cell response, perhaps because T cells with TCRs specific for those pMHCs are deleted in thymus (i.e. those foreign pMHCs look like self ones)**
# An anti-CD3 antibody, teplizumab, in relatives at risk for type 1 diabetes
 - teplizumab delays progression of type 1 diabetes in high risk participants
 - KLRG1<sup>+</sup> TIGIT<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells more common in teplizumab group than placebo
# An increased population of regulatory T cells improves the pathophysiology of placental ischemia in a rat model of preeclampsia
 - preeclampsia pathology: suppressed Tregs, autoantibodies to Ang II type I receptor
# Antigen presentation in the thymus for positive selection and central tolerance induction
## Key points
 - interactions with self-peptide-MHC complexes on thymic epithelial cells crucial for thmocyte survival (positive selection) and CD4 vs. CD8 lineage commitment but can also result in negative selection (apoptosis)
 - migratory DCs carry peripheral self antigens into thymus, extend scope of intrathymically presented self antigens
## Main
### Positive selection and CD4 or CD8 lineage committment
 - in cortex of thymus
 - selection paradox: recognition of self is essential for thymocyte survival and lineage commitment but may also induce negative selection
 - **affinity model: only TCR-pMHC interactions with intermediate affinity allow positive selection and CD4 or CD8 lineage commitment (no or too low affinity leads to apoptosis due to neglect which is about 80-90% of lost thymocytes during selection and very high affinity contacts lead to apoptosis by negative selection i.e. clonal deletion)**
 - deviation of autoreactive thymocytes into Treg cells (CD25<sup>+</sup>) not explained by affinity model
 - cathepsins (lysosomal proteases) and thymus-specific serine protease alter MHC ligand repertoire presented to T cells during development, helps positive selection
### Antigen presentation in the medulla
 - transcriptional noise (low level transcription of any gene) may expose developing thymocytes to antigenic diversity of peripheral tissue (tissue-restricted antigens) without those peripheral antigens needing to be transited to thymus, not just inherent leaky gene expression but rather promiscuous gene expression and a distinct property of medullary thymic epithelial cells (1-3% of these cells express a particular tissue-restricted antigen but the cells get replace weekly changing topology of antigen expression in medulla)
# Anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapies in cancer: mechanisms of action, efficacy, and limitations
## Cancers evade and inhibit immune responses
 - cytokines (like IL-12) also help effective T cell stimulation
 - immunoediting: selection of clones able to avoid immune system leading to tumor establishment
 - evasion mechanisms: downregulation of tumor antigens or MHC class I, use of inhibitory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), use of inhibitory Tregs, Bregs, or myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or inhibitory receptors (PD-1, CTLA-4)
## Immune exhaustion contributes to immune dysfunction in cancer
 - exhaustion can lead to deletion (following progressive loss of proliferative potential and effector functions)
## The immune checkpoint receptor CTLA-4
 - CTLA-4 expressed by Tregs, also CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upon activation, also exhausted T cells
 - CTLA-4 outcompetes CD28 for CD80/86 ligands and can remove ligands CD80/86 from APC surface via trans-endocytosis
 - CTLA-4 increases activation threshold of T cells (limits CD28-mediated signaling during antigen presentation to reduce immune responses to weak antigens like self/tumor antigens)
## The immune checkpoint receptor PD-1
 - follicular helper T cells constitutively express PD-1
 - PD-1 expressed by activated/induced T cells (TCR stimulation or cytokines like IL-2/7/15/21 or TGF-β)
 - IFN-γ upregulates PD-L1/2
## CTLA-4, PD-1, and their ligands in cancer
 - CTLA-4 expression on tumors associated with decreased survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma but increased survival in NSCLC
 - CTLA-4 blockade likely mostly impacts T cell activation in draining lymph node when CTLA-4 expressing Tregs remove CD80/86 from surface of APCs (reducing their ability to stimulate tumor-specific T cells), possibly also at tumor site as exhauted CTLA-4 expressing T cells and Tregs accumulate in tumor microenvironment
 - PD-1 blockade thought to act mainly at effector stage of immune response
## Limitations of immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - selection for tumor cells that can evade immune system (perhaps they lose MHC class I or IFN-γ response elements)
 - ICB can induce upregulation of other inhibitory receptors
# Antiplatelet drugs may increase the risk for checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis in advanced cancer patients
 - mechanism: changed immune landscape within tumor microenvironemnt, platelets' role in circulation and immune system being disturbed
 - platelet-derived PD-L1 reported to promote immune evasion and contribute to tumor growth by inhibiting CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes
# A phenotypically and functionally distinct human T<sub>H2</sub> cell subpopulation is associated with allergic disorders
 - allergen-specific type 2 helper T (T<sub>H2</sub>) cells critical in initiating/orchestrating allergic/asthmatic inflammatory response pathways
 - currently lack methodology to identify and differentiate these cells from nonpathogenic T<sub>H2</sub> cell types (otherwise would be able to use them as therapeutic targets and biomarkers)
 - here, they describe a subset of human memory T<sub>H2</sub> cells confined to atopic (hypersensitivity reaction occurs in part of body not in contact with allergen) individuals that includes all allergen-specific T<sub>H2</sub> cells, denoted as T<sub>H2A</sub> cells, characterized by co-expression of CRTH2, CD49d, and CD161 and exhibit numerous functional attributes distinct from conventional T<sub>H2</sub> cells
 - transcriptome analysis reveals distinct pathway in initiation of pathogenic responses to allergen
 - elimination of these cells is indicative of clinical responses induced by immunotherapy
# Association between immune-related side effects and efficacy and benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors - a systemic review and meta-analysis
## Highlights
 - association between irAEs and clinical benefit across all solid tumors regardless of ICI type
## Abstract
 - grade 3 or higher irAEs (severe irAEs) resulted in better objective response rate but worse overall survival
## Introduction
 - ICIs can unleash T cells with subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon γ, TNF, can result in excessive off-tumor inflammation and autoimmunity
# Association of antithyroglobulin antibodies with the development of thyroid dysfunction induced by nivolumab
 - pre-existing thryoglobulin antibodies (TgAb) and elevated TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) associated with development of thyroid dysfunction induced by nivolumab
# Association of checkpoint inhibitor-induced toxic effects with shared cancer and tissue antigens in non-small cell lung cancer
 - irAEs more common in patients with complete/partial remission than in those with progressive/stable disease, **autoimmune adverse effects are associated with response to therapy**
 - **identify 9 T cell antigens shared between tumor and skin (including desmocollin 3, keratin 6, mapsin, LL37, keratin 14), different from crossreactivity hypothesis seems to just be exact same antigen shared between tumor and self**, these antigens stimulate T cells *in vitro* (significant for CD8<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> but not CD4<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> T cells)
 - **seems like most similar self tissue to tumor has highest chance of irAE, skin second most similar to NSCLC after lung and had second highest proportion of irAEs**
 - **see dense infiltration of T cells in sites of irAEs**
 - **same T cell clonotypes infiltrated both lung tumor and autoimmune skin lesions**
 - **not all tumors harbor potent neoantigens, effective immunotherapy favors neoantigens**
# Association of immune-related adverse events with nivolumab efficacy in non-small-cell lung cancer
 - irAEs observed in 51% of patients (9% grades 3 or 4 i.e. severe irAEs)
 - irAEs associated with better overall survival
# Association of vitiligo with tumor response in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with pembrolizumab
 - 25% of patients developed vitiligo
 - **objective response associated with higher occurrence of vitiligo**
# Autoimmune panels as predictors of toxicity in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ALERT)
 - auto antigen microarray to profile autoantibodies related to irAEs in patients receiving ICI
 - greater number of IgG and IgM reactivites in pre-ICI in patients vs. healthy controls
 - patients with severe irAEs had pre-ICI IgG reactivity to more autoantigens than patients who didn't develop severe irAEs
 - post-treatment increase in IgM reactivities in people developing irAEs, decrease in IgG levels after steroids
# Autoreactive napsin A-specific T cells are enriched in lung tumors and inflammatory lung lesions during immune checkpoint blockade
## Summary
 - DITAS: discovery of tumor-associated self-antigens to find peptides that induce both antitumor and irAE responses, analyze shared antigens between NSCLC and lung tissue, determine which HLA peptides bind to, predicting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes of peptides
## Abstract
 - DITAS computes transcriptional similarity between lung tumors and healthy lung tissue, identify 10 lung tissue-specific genes highly expressed in lung tumors
 - napsin A: self antigen that elicited strong CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, ICB responders have higher napsin A-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies than non-responders
 - HLA class I ligands from napsin A present in human lung tumors and non-tumor lung tissue
 - napsin A-specific T cell clonotypes enriched in lung tumors and ICB-induced inflammatory lung lesions, able to kill HLA-matched NSCLC cells *ex vivo* and express proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic markers
## Introduction
 - **vitiligo being more common in patients with melanoma treated with ICB is evidence for shared antigens (GP100, MART-1, tyrosinase) underlying irAEs and clinical response, similarly pneumonitis (alveoli wall inflammation) more common in ICB-treated patients with NSCLC than those with melanoma**
## Results
### DITAS: an approach to identify tumor-associated antigens based on tissue similarities
 - melanoma cells resemble melanocytes, NSCLC cells resemble lung tissue by mRNA expression, as expected, then perhaps also similar antigenic profiles
### Validation of napsin A as a lung tumor self-antigen
 - MART-1 and GP100 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses greater in patients with melanoma than in those with NSCLC
 - **recognition of specific antigens varied markedly between patients**
### Functional relevance of napsin A-specific T cells
 - ICB responders had higher frequencies of napsin A-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after stimulation with napsin A peptide pool compared with nonresponders
## Discussion
 - T cells thought to be major mediators of irAEs (activity enhanced by ICB)
 - theories for breached regulation of T cell activity during ICB: **neoantigen (T cells targeting cancer neoantigens cross-react with WT version of protein in healthy tissue)** and tissue-associated antigen (antigens shared between tumor and healthy tissue) theories
# Autoreactive T cell receptors with shared germline-like α chains in type 1 diabetes
## Abstract
 - identify class of TCRs that share TCR α chains between individuals ("public" chains, scRNAseq)
 - use multiplexed CD154 enrichment to isolate IAR T cells from peripheral blood
 - identify paired TCRαβ sequences from 2,767 cells, more than 1/4 share TCR junctions between 2 or more cells ("expanded"), and ~62% of expanded TCRs show specificity for islet antigen epitopes
 - public TCR sharing TCRα junctions most prominent in new-onset T1D
 - public TCR sequences more germline-like than expanded, unique, "private" TCRs and had shorter junction sequences (fewer random nucleotide insertions)
 - public TCRα junctions most often paired with mismatched TCRβ junctions in TCRs, a subset of these TCRs cross-reactive towards distinct islet antigen peptides
 - takehome: population of IAR T cells with diverse specificities determined by TCRs with restricted TCRα junctions and germline-constrained antigen recognition properties
 - "innate-like" TCRs differ from immunodominant TCRβ chains in autoimmunity
## Introduction
 - human islet antigen reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells (IAR T cells) involved in β cell destruction, perhaps biomark T1D
 - the extreme diversity of TCR sequences allows for private expanded TCR clonotypes, but public expanded TCR sequences are also sometimes observed (perhaps a continuum rather than a binary public/private)
 - shared public sequences prominent in TCRs recognizing microbial antigens, **I wonder why**, and have been implicated in autoimmune disease
## Results
### Expanded IAR T cells recognize multiple islet epitopes
 - recombinant lentiviral transduction to ectopically express TCR sequences in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - **expanded TCRs had multiple specificities**
 - most often TCRs recognized GAD65 peptides, then IGRP, then ZNT8 (there were more GADD65 peptides in the pool though), surprisingly no recognition of preproinsulin epitope
### Expanded public IAR TCRs are more prevalent in new-onset T1D
### Public TCRs are more germline like
 - junction length inversely related to germline-ness (fewer nontemplated nucleotide additions i.e. shorter junction means more germline-like)
## Discussion
 - increased frequency of public TCRs in IAR T cells of new-onset T1D patients relative to established T1D patients, perhaps due to a dilution of specificities as epitope spreading occurs, migration of islet antigen-specific T cells to pancreas, or clone contraction due to antigen loss during islet destruction
 - **would expect more germline-like TCRs to be more cross-reactive (lower sequence complexity)**
 - **cross-reactivity need not result from sequence similarity (3D structural similarity more important than 1D sequence similarity)**

# B cells as biomarkers: predicting immune checkpoint therapy adverse events

# B cell-specific MHC class II deletion reveals multiple nonredundant roles for B cell antigen presentation in murine lupus

 - Ab-independent functions could include roles in lymphoid development, cytokine secretion, Ag presentation
# Biomarkers of checkpoint inhibitor induced immune-related adverse events - a comprehensive review
 - blood-based, immunogenetic and microbial biomarkers predicting irAEs prior to and during ICI therapy
 - no single biomarker has proven to be sufficiently predictive for irAE development
 - **CTLA-4 expression on Tregs can lead to trans-endocytosis of CD80/86 ligands (B7-1/2) on APCs, leaving APCs without costimulatory factors**
 - the higher frequency of autoantibody-related irAEs such as thyroid disorders in PD-1 treated patients could be a result of the modulation of humoral immunity by PD-1-inhibitors or of its effects on self-tolerance. 
 - **baseline markers: peripheral blood lymphocyte counts > 2,000, lower % PD-1 expression on T cells, lower % Tregs, lower IL-6/8 levels, higher IL-17 levels, autoantibodies, some HLA alleles, among other things all associated with more irAEs**
 - **on treatment markers: increased leukocyte count, clonal expansion of more T cell clones, more newly emerging T cell clones, decline in T cell clonality, increased IL-6 levels, among other things all associated with more irAEs**
 - **takehome for me: on treatment markers including clonal expansion of more T cell clones, more newly emerging T cell clones, decline in T cell clonality all very interestingly associated with more irAEs**
# Broad TCR repertoire and diverse structural solutions for recognition of an immunodominant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitope

# CD28/PD1 co-expression: dual impact on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood and tumor tissue, and its significance in NSCLC patients' survival and ICB response
## Background
 - exhaustion is now recognized to have a dynamic progression from a long-lived "pre-exhausted stem-like progenitor" (more responsive likely to re-invigoration by ICB) to a "terminally exhausted" state
 - **CD28 is a prerequisite for optimal T cell re-invigoration following PD1 blockade, CD28 primary target downstream of PD1-mediated inhibitory signaling**
 - **main finding: signatures of heterogeneous tumor infiltrating TRM and “pre-exhausted” long-lived effector-memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were associated with better ICB response only in the presence of CD28**
# CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are essential for the development of destructive thyroiditis induced by anti-PD-1 antibody in thyroglobulin-immunized mice
## Abstract
 - PD-1 blockade in thyroglobulin-immunized mice induces destructive thyroiditis, prevented by previous depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and partially prevented by previous depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets (central and effector memory) frequencies and interferon γ production after stimulation with thyroglobulin increased in lymph nodes of mice with thyroid irAE over controls
 - infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing granzyme B in thyroid glands and MHC class II expression on thyrocytes in mice with thyroid irAE
 - adoptive transfer of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from lymph nodes in mice with thyroid irAE destroys thryoid follicular architecture in irradiated recipient mice
 - frequencies of central and effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD27 (CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxic marker) higher in PBMCs from human patients with thyroid irAE induced by PD-1 blockade than those without (also higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies in general), similar CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies
## Discussion
 - mouse destructive thyroiditis only induced by PD-1 blockade with prior immunization with thyroglobulin, so there's an involvement of activated memory cells specific for thyroglobulin in irAEs (memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induced by previous immunization with thyroglobulin activated by PD-1 blockade and cause irAE)

# CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the cancer-immunity cycle
## Introduction
 - 3 signal model for effective T cell priming and differentiation: 1) TCR signaling by antigens presented by MHCs, 2) co-stimulation, 3) cytokines, all 3 signals necessary to effectively prime naive T cells and differentiate them into effector T cells, perhaps a fourth signal being nutrients/metabolites fueling T cell metabolism
## CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation states
 - with optimal signals (vaccinations, acutely resolving infections), naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into effector T cells (T<sub>eff</sub> cells) or memory precursors, then into long-lived memory T cells once the antigen is cleared
 - memory T cell population is heterogeneous: stem cell memory (Tscm), central memory (Tcm), effector memory (Tem), effector memory re-expressing CD45RA (Temra), tissue resident memory (Trm)
 - persistent stimulation (especially via TCR) leads to exhaustion (epigenetically coordinated by transcription factor TOX)
 - exhausted T cells characterized by high co-expression of multiple inhibitory receptors (PD-1, CD39, LAG-3) and reduced proportion of effector cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF, IL-2)
 - exhausted T cells are not non-functional but rather have altered effector function (adapted to withstand chronic antigen stimulation), maintain moderate control while avoiding excessive immunopathology
 - **inflection point of irreversible exhaustion seems to be 2-3 weeks of chronic antigen stimulation, major epigenetic and transcriptional changes**
## Signals
### Signal 1: TCR signaling and antigens
 - tumor-associated antigens (differentiation, overexpressed, cancer germ line or testis antigens, ERV-derived antigens), T cells targeting these may express TCRs with low affinity (autoreactive)
 - tumor-specific antigens (~foreign antigens, neoantigens or viral proteins in the cases of oncogenic viruses), T cells specific to tumor-specific antigens aren't subject to central tolerance
 - most neoantigens are patient specific, requiring individualized treatment (perhaps mRNA vaccines?)
 - immune editing: on-target T cell responses can lead to the elimination of tumor subpopulations expressing immunogenic antigens, resulting in eventual tumor escape as resistant tumor subpopulations are selected for
### Signal 2: Co-stimulation and co-inhibition
 - co-stimulation from CD80/86 ligands on APC (upregulated in infections) received via CD28 receptor on T cell, leading to full activation of the T cell (survival, metabolism, cytokine production)
 - other co-stimulatory molecules: CD40L, OX40, 4-1BB, **ICOS**, CD27, involved in priming/later stages of T cell differentiation
 - following activation, T cells increase CTLA-4 expression (outcompetes CD28 for CD80/86 and regulates extent and duration of T cell activation to prevent excessive immunopathology), other negative signals include PD-1, LAG-3, 2B4, TIGIT, TIM-3
### Signal 3: Cytokines
 - IL-12, type I IFN, also IL-1/6/10/18/27/33 and TGFβ, among others
# CD8 T cell function and crossreactivity explored by stepwise increased peptide-HLA versus TCR affinity
 - vaccines with native tumor epitope (vs. HLA affinity-optimized epitope) generated T cells eith better functionality and enhanced crossreactivity against potential low affinity escape epitopes
 - cumulative impact of peptide:HLA and TCR-peptide:HLA affinity on T cell responses
# Cellular and molecular waypoints along the path of T cell exhaustion
# Changes of peripheral T cell subsets in melanoma patients with immune-related adverse events
## T cell changes in patients with severe irAEs receiving anti-PD-1 monotherapy
 - no clear differences
## Changes in T cell subsets in patients with severe irAEs receiving dual immune checkpoint blockade
 - **decreased frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and increased frequency of CD56<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells before and after the start of the treatment**
 - **increased frequency of EMRA CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells seen before and after start of dual ICB**

## Abstract
 - pre-treatment monocyte and neutrophil counts also predicted clinical outcome (negatively prognostic)
 - DEGs in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by irAE development, patients not developing irAEs had upregulated *CXCR1* pre/post-treatment
## Background
 - it's not consistently observed but sometimes observed that there's an association between irAE development and improved treatment response (suggesting a link between reduced tolerance to self-antigens and tumor antigens)
## Results
### Association of irAE development with divergent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell gene expression
 - peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expression profiles have been linked with clinical outcome
 - **gene pathways including chemokine-mediated signaling, extracellular matrix organisation, and platelet degranulation altered in irAE development**
### *CXCR1* and irAE
 - increased *CXCR1* expression (and *CXCR2* but less so) associated with reduced irAE development
 - *CXCR1/2* encode chemokine receptors for IL-8
 - IL-8 levels a negative prognostic
## Discussion
 - sex is more likely to be associated with autoimmune incidence than irAE development, so classical risk factors for autoimmunity may be less relevant for irAEs, **back to Peter's point of not treating them the same**
 - different irAEs occur at different times (cutaneous ones, colitis, hepatitis early, gastritis and pneumonitis late), suggesting divergent pathophysiology
 - **they say steroids and other immunosuppressants used to manage irAEs are unlikely to affect prognosis, which surprises me as I thought they could interfere with the anti-tumor activities of ICB**
 - **see baseline changes in single ICB recipients who proceeded to develop irAE with enrichment in complement activity, innate immunity and neutrophil degranulation pathways**
# Chimeric CTLA-4-CD28-CD3z T cells potentiate antitumor activity against CD80/CD86-positive B cell malignancies
 - overcome inhibitive microenvironment of tumor by making chimeric CTLA-4 (extracellular and transmembrane domains) CD28/CD3z (cytoplasmic domains) protein, so off signal becomes on signal
 - CTLA-4 upregulated after T cell activation, to prevent too much activation?
 - CD80/86 are CTLA-4 ligands
 - CAR T cells (chimeric antigen receptor T cells): extracellular ligand recognition domain (single chain variable fragment, ScFv) fused to signaling domain of CD3z, intracellular costimulatory molecule (CD28, 4-1BB, ICOS, CD40, or CD27)
# Clinical characteristics and treatment of immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors
## Mechanisms of irAEs
 - hypotheses: ICI usage breaks up homeostasis and reduces T cell tolerance, cross-reactivity of T cells between tumor cells and normal tissue, ICI usage can increase pre-existing autoantibody levels as well as inflammatory cytokine levels, ICI can disturb CTLA-4/PD-L1 blocks in tissue expressing those inhibitory receptors to protect normal tissue
# Clinical outcome following checkpoint therapy in renal cell carcinoma is associated with a burst of activated CD8 T cells in blood
## Abstract
 - small proportion of CD4 and CD8 T cells in blood activate following ICB (express Ki67 and cell cycle genes, activation markers HLA-DR, CD38, also effector molecules like granzymes, CXCR3)
 - patients with highest increase in HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells after treatment had best antitumor responses and clinical benefit
 - these cells expanded in most patients but phenotype didn't change much during treatment, but **only patients with clinical benefit had burst of new clonotypes enter HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell pool of activated cells**
## Introduction
 - new CD8 clonotypes enter blood after ICB and this increase in clonotypes is associated with better survival, so these are newly activated or reactivated (dormant?) clones
 - CD8 T cell infiltration into tumor also associated with better survival
## Discussion
 - phenotype of effector seems less important than number and repertoire of T cells responding to treatment
 - patients with more CD8 T cells in tumor exhibit better survival, better infiltration also not surprising here to help out
 - hypothesis for **model: pool of tumor-specific TCF-1<sup>+</sup> stem-like CD8 T cells that aren't proliferating or generating antitumor effector cells that are a reservoir unleashed by ICB, seen by large burst of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup+</sup> CD8 T cells after ICB and new repertoire**
# Clonal dynamics of alloreactive T cells in kidney allograft rejection after anti-PD-1 therapy
## Discussion
 - alloreactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells clonally expanded after ICI, acquired distinctive transcriptomic signature, accumulated in transplanted kidney during ICB-mediated allograft rejection
 - despite 10 years of stable allograft function, alloreactive T cells remained present in kidney transplant recipient (unleashed by ICB), so didn't see clonal deletion
# Clonal exhaustion as a mechanism to protect against severe immunopathology and death from an overwhelming CD8 T cell response
 - possible evolutionary reason for T cell exhaustion
# Clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in the systemic circulation precedes development of ipilimumab-induced toxicities
## Significance
 - CD8 T cell clonal expansion within systemic circulation potential correlative biomarker of irAEs in prostate cancer patients receiving ICI
## Abstract
 - 27 metastatic prostate cancer patients
 - sequencing of TCRβ chains revealed clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in blood samples collected before irAE onset
 - expansion of > 55 CD8 T cell clones preceeded severe irAE onset
## Introduction
 - **hypothesis: clonal expansion of T cells in systemic circulation, which could be reactive against self-antigens, may correlate with irAEs (analogous to clonal expansion of T cells in tumor tissues, which are likely tumor reactive, perhaps predicting clinical benefit with immune checkpoint therapy)**
## Results
### Evaluation for biomarkers that may correlate with clinical outcomes
 - increased ICOS<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells biomarker of ICI
 - clinically benefitting patients more likely to have higher levels of CD3 T cells expressing CTLA-4 in pre-treatment blood
 - also see better clinical response from patients with increased baseline CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> CD3 T cell to PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD3 T cell ratio, perhaps due to here using CTLA-4 blockade?
 - pre-/on-treatment T cell clonality didn't correlate with clinical outcomes but **CD8 T cell clonal expansion was greater in patients developing severe irAEs**
### Circulating CD8 T cell clonal expansion precedes the development of grade 2-3
## Discussion
 - previous literature has suggested increased T cell clonality in tumor microenvironment correlates with clinical response to PD-1 blockade
 - **most irAEs are similar irregardless of tumor/blockade type, so perhaps there's a common mechanism underlying irAEs**
 - immunosuppressive therapies can be used to treat irAEs, shorter course required if used sooner (but early irAE manifestations can be subtle)
# Clonal expansion of resident memory T cells in peripheral blood of patients with non-small cell lung cancer durine immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment
 - among T cell subtypes, effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> TEM GZMK PDCD1) were increased after ICI treatment in both DCB and NCB
 - effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells resided at the bifurcation point, which has the potential to differentiate into lineages with precursor exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> TCM cells) assumed to be related to the ICI response
 - effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells along with T cells recognizing unknown antigen expanded and composed of novel clones skewed toward dysfunctional status, especially in on-treatment samples of the durable clinical benefit group
# Clonal replacement of tumor-specific T cells following PD-1 blockade
## Abstract
 - unclear if ICB relies/works on reinvigoration of pre-existing tumor infiltrating T cells or on recruitment of novel T cells
 - clonally-expanded cells were highly enriched in exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and expressed markers of tumor specificity, including CD39 and CD103
 - expansion didn't derive from pre-existing TIL clones but rather from novel clonotypes not previously observed in the same tumor (clonal replacement)
 - pre-existing tumor-specific T cells may have limited reinvigoration capacity due to chronic activation/exhaustion (epigenetic remodeling); the T cell response to checkpoint blockade derives from a distinct repertoire of T cell clones that may have just recently entered the tumor
 - **novel T cell clones could derive from lymphoid organs or rare unexpanded clones within TME/tumor periphery that weren't exhausted**
# Co-regulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion by multiple inhibitory receptors during chronic viral infection
 - co-expression of multiple distinct inhibitory receptors associated with greater T cell exhaustion and more severe infection (in context of chronic infection causing T cell exhaustion)
 - blockade of T cell inhibitory receptors PD-1, LAG-3 reinvigorate T cells
# Correlation between vitiligo occurrence and clinical benefit in advanced melanoma patients treated with nivolumab: A multi-institutional retrospective study
 - occasionally see vitiligo in melanoma patients
 - some propose correlation between vitiligo occurrence and clinical response in melanoma patients receiving immunotherapy, but most studies have included heterogeneous patient and treatment settings
 - goal: investigate correlation between vitiligo occurrence and clinical benefit of immunotherapy
 - results: vitiligo occurrence correlated with favorable clinical outcome
# Crossreactivity of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A-specific T cells in individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2
## Abstract
 - geographical association between high influenza vaccination rates and lower incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infection (crossreactive T cells)
 - heterologous immunity
 - use artificial APCs and RT-qPCR to screen for antigen-specific T cell responses, see correlation between responses to SARS-CoV-2 epitope and IAV dominant epitope
 - TCR repertoires of crossreactive and IAV-specific T cells reveals similarities
## Discussion
 - **heterologous immunity may be beneficial in short run (crossreactive memory T cells primed to quickly respond to new antigen) but may be detrimental in long run (narrows TCR diversity, promotes development of viral escape variants)**
# CTLA-4 blockade enhances polyfunctional NY-ESO-1 specific T cell responses in metastatic melanoma patients with clinical benefit
 - 5/8 of patients with clinical benefit to CTLA-4 blockade had NY-ESO-1 antibody (and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against NY-ESO-1), 0/7 of clinical non-responders had NY-ESO-1 antibody
 - NY-ESO-1 is a cancer antigen
 - T cell responses were polyfunctional (IFN-γ, MIP-1β, TNF-α)
 - all 8 patients with clinical benefit had at least 1 irAE, but 87% of all patients had at least one irAE, so it doesn't seem like there was a huge difference in irAE incidence between those with clinical benefit and those without
# Current best practices in single cell RNA-seq analysis: a tutorial
## Data production
 - single cell suspension generated by dissociating tissue
 - isolate single cells: plate-based (single cells into wells) or droplet based (single cells into droplets), both methods can lead to multiple cells being captured together, no cells being captured (empty wells/droplets), or non-viable cells being captured
 - each well/droplet contains chemicals to break open cells and construct libraries (mRNA reverse transcribed to cDNA, amplified, well/droplet-specific barcodes, also often label molecules with UMI), amplify before sequencing to increase probability of capturing molecules, UMIs allow distinguishing between amplified copies of the same mRNA molecule (don't count separately) and reads from separate mRNA molecules transcribed from the same gene (do count separately)
 - after constructing libraries, cellular cDNA libraries are labelled with cellular barcodes, sometimes UMIs too
 - then pool libraries together (multiplexing) for sequencing to produce read data
## Raw data processing
 - group raw data based on barcodes (demultiplexing), align reads, demultiplex based on UMIs to take read data into count data (counts of captured mRNAs), called count matrices/molecular counts if UMIs were used and read counts/read matrices if UMIs weren't used
 - demultiplex, align to genome, quantify
 - dimensions of data are number of barcodes (ideally meaning cell but not always the case as when a barcode may mistakenly tag multiple different cells i.e. in a doublet/multiplet or may not tag any cells at all in the case of empty wells/droplets) by number of transcripts
## Quality control
 - ensure that all barcode data correspond to viable cells
 - perform QC on count depth (number of counts per barcode), number of genes per barcode, and fraction of counts from mitochondrial genes per barcode
 - outliers can correspond to dying cells, cells with broken cell membranes (but perhaps intact mitochondrial membranes leaving few counts and detected genes but a high mitochondrial count fraction), doublets/multiplets
 - high mitochondrial count fraction could also just mean that the cell is very active in cellular respiration though
 - low counts/genes could also just mean quiescent cells
 - high counts/genes could also just mean large cells
# Cytomegalovirus in autoimmunity: T cell crossreactivity to viral antigen and autoantigen glutamic acid decarboxylase
## Abstract
 - foreign antigens that mimic autoantigens can trigger autoimmunity, for example viral infections associated with T1D development
 - GAD65 is a major autoantigen of T1D and stiff-man syndrome
 - screen synthetic peptide libraries dedicated to bind to HLA-DR3, which predisposes people to T1D and stiff-man syndrome, using clonal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells reactive to GAD65 isolated from prediabetic stiff-man syndrome patient
 - result: GAD65-specific T cells crossreact with peptide of hCMV major DNA binding protein, hCMV-derived epitope can be processed by DCs and recognized by GAD65-reactive T cells
 - **takehome: hCMV may be involved in loss of T cell tolerance to autoantigen GAD65 by a mechanism of molecular mimicry leading to autoimmunity, perhaps analogous to loss of tolerance to autoantigens by mechanism of molecular mimicry between tumor antigen and self antigen leading to irAEs**
## Introduction
 - GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase) neuroenzyme expressed in neurons and β cells
## Discussion
 - clonal T cells recognizing GAD65 339-352 crossreact with hCMV major DNA-binding protein pUL57 peptide 674-687, peptide efficiently processed for presentation by HLA-DR3
 - crossreactive response may be polyclonal, so T cells recognizing hCMV peptide more efficiently than GAD65 peptide may exist
# Defining the memory CD8 T cell
 - effector (T<sub>em</sub>, CD62L<sup>low</sup>CCR7<sup>low</sup>) and central (T<sub>cm</sub>, CD62L<sup>high</sup>CCR7<sup>high</sup>) memory T cells
 - CCR7/CD62L expression on T<sub>cm</sub> cells facilitates homing to secondary lymph organs, while T<sub>em</sub> cells are more cytolytic and express integrins and chemokine receptors to localize to inflamed tissue
 - tissue resident memory (T<sub>rm</sub>) T cells: permanent residents in tissue (rather than circulating like T<sub>em</sub> cells), integrins CD103/CD49a help enter tissue, CD69 helps with tissue retention
# Deletion of *SNX9* alleviates CD8 T cell exhaustion for effective cellular cancer immunotherapy
# Deletion of the inhibitory co-receptor CTLA-4 enhances and invigorates chimeric antigen receptor T cells
 - deletion of *CTLA4* permits unopposed CD28 signaling in CAR T cells
 - PD-1 deficiency nullifies CD28 signaling enabled by *CTLA4* deletion in CAR T cells
# Dendritic cells as shepherds of T cell immunity in cancer
# Depletion of exhausted alloreactive T cells enables targeting of stem-like memory T cells to generate tumor-specific immunity
 - alloreactivity refers to ability of T cells to recognize peptide-allogenic-MHC complexes not encountered during thymic development (HLA/MHC-mismatch recognition, manifestation of transplant rejection and graft-versus-host disease)
 - find that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion in bone marrow was primarily alloantigen-driven
# Differentiation and homeostasis of effector Treg cells are regulated by inositol polyphosphates modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx
 - subclass of Tregs express Foxp3, activated Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs differentiate into effector Treg (eTreg) cells to maintain peripheral immune homeostasis and tolerance
# Digital spatial profiling of melanoma shows CD95 expression in immune cells is associated with resistance to immunotherapy
# Distinct cellular mechanisms underlie anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade
 - goal: elucidate mechanism by which ICI (immune checkpoint inhibitors) induce tumor rejection
 - mass cytometry approach to profile effects of ICI on tumor immune infiltrates in human melanoma and murine tumor models
 - results: ICI targets subsets of tumor infiltrating T cells
 - **PD-1 blockade predominantly induces expansion of specific tumor infiltrating exhausted-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets**
 - **CTLA-4 blockade induces expansion of ICOS<sup>+</sup> Th1-like CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells, also engages specific subsets of exhausted-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells**
 - **different ICI target different T cell subsets**
# Distinct mechanisms of mismatch repair deficiency delineate two modes of response to PD-1 immunotherpy in endometrial carcinoma
## Abstract
 - mismatch repair-deficient cancers have varied responses to immune checkpoint blockade
 - patients with mutational mismatch repair-deficient endometrial cancers (higher mutational burden) here had higher response rates, longer survival rates than those with epigenetic mismatch repair-deficient tumors, but mutational burden not correlated with ICB response within each category
 - longitudinal scRNAseq: CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells correlated with regression of mutational mismatch repair-deficient tumors, activated CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells associated with ICB-responsive epigenetic mismatch repair-deficient tumors
## Introduction
 - mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) cancers have high mutational loads, especially at repetitive microsatellite regions prone to replication errors (microsatellite instability-high, MSI-H)
 - high mutational burden thought to make many tumor neoantigens that immune system can target
 - however, even among MSI-H/mismatch repair-deficient tumors, ICB response rate varies within and across cancer types (for example 44, 57, 18, 0% responses in colorectal, endometrial, pancreatic, brain cancers respectively)
 - > 70% of MSI-H/MMRd endometrial cancer cases have epigenetic rather than mutational "silencing" (of MLH1 gene promoter, DNA methylation), i.e. epigenetic rather than mutational MMRd
 - here, they classify patients into mutational or epigenetic MMRd, see 100% objective response rate, faster clinical response, and longer progression-free survival for mutational-MMRd patients vs. epigenetic-MMRd patients (44% ORR)
 - uncover two distinct axes of anti-tumor immunity in mutational vs. epigenetic MMRd tumors
## Results
### The molecular mechanism of mismatch repair deficiency impacts tumor mutation burden and response to immunotherapy
 - group patients into mutational or epigenetic MMRd by MLH1 promoter methylation analysis, whole exome sequencing, PCR, immunohistochemistry for MMR proteins, get 6 mutational and 18 epigenetic MMRd patients
 - PD-1 blockade (treated every 3 weeks) responders defined as patients with > 30% decrease in tumor size, all mutational and 44% of epigenetic MMRd patients responded to PD-1 blockade
 - faster response kinetics in mutational MMRd patients, also longer progression-free survival and overall survival compared to epi-MMRd patients
 - **don't observe differences in tumor mutational burden between responders and non-responders within each group (i.e. MMRd type), so while mutational MMRd has higher TMB and higher response rate, it's not the whole picture**
### Association between specific gene mutations and immunotherapy response
 - find commonly mutated genes: PTEN, ARID1A, RPL22, KMT2B, and KMT2D
 - mutations in ARID1A (subunit of BAF SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, commonly mutated in cancer) and CTCF (TF for 3D chromatin organizer, binding sites often mutated in cancer) associaed with PD-1 blockade response
 - ARID1A deficiency associated previosuly with enhanced ICB responsiveness, but here they see the opposite (mutations associated with PD-1 blockade resistance)
 - prior studies have indicated that JAK1 mutations can protect tumor cells from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxicity by disabling IFN-γ pathway signal transduction, JAK1 loss suggested to confer ICB resistance
 - 42% of tumors in this study had pathogenic/deleterious JAK1 mutations before treatment, but pre-treatment JAK1 mutations are not found here to be associated with PD-1 blockade resistance (even slightly see the opposite), complete response observed in 3 paitnets with tumors largely comprised of JAK1-mutant cells
 - JAK1 mutations may be advantageous for endometrial cancer by subverting immuen surveillance, 3 patients' tumors acquire JAK1 mutations following PD-1 blockade, but pre-treatment JAK1 mutations don't necessarily confer PD-1 blockade resistance (3 tumors with complete PD-1 blockade response had near-clonal JAK1 mutations at baseline)
### Longitudinal single cell transcriptional profiling of circulating immune cells
 - they were interested in immunological mechanisms driving differential ICB responses across patients (tumor mutational burden alone couldn't explain)
 - paired scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq on over 260,000 PBMCs (n = 52 samples)
 - compare relative frequencies of cell types across timepoints and patient categories, do not see differences
### Mutational MMRd is associated with effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses
 - prior to ICB, mutational MMRd (but not epigenetic MMRd) had enrichment for specific subpopulations of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (high expression of KLRG1, EOMES, LAG3, lower expression of inhibitory receptors PDCD1, CTLA4, KLRC1 encoding NKG2A) compared to non-responders, indicative of a poised subpopulation
 - after ICB, mutR patients enriched for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subpopulations (elevated expression of cytolytic effectors GZMB, GNLY, TNF but not IFNG, reduced expression of inhibitory receptors TIM-3, PDCD1, LAG3), epiR patients didn't show this, indicative of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population in mutR patients
 - no differences in TCR clonality (Simpson's clonality index) among patient categories before/after ICB, but increased clonality in responders, particularly subset of mutR patients
 - use pre-treatment bulk TCR-seq data from TILs, create reference library of tumor-reactive TCRs in patients, identify tumor-reactive clonotypes among peripheral T cells
 - quantify percentage of circulating T cells with TIL-matching TCR sequences in each sample, no differences prior to treatment but increase in TIL-matched circulating T cells in mutR patients compared to NR, in line with expansion of peripheral T cell populations with ICB
 - patients with JAK1-mutant tumors don't have systemic differences in composition of circulating immune response
### Distinct transcriptional profiles of circulating immune cells in epigenetic MMRd responders
 - unlike mutR patients, epiR patients had similar TMB as NR patients and didn't show enrichment for activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, so mutational vs. epigenetic mechanism of MMRd affects intensity of microsatellite instability
 - wanted to study transcriptional profiles of epi-MMRd tumors that respond vs. don't respond to PD-1 blockade
 - random sample to partition cells in each sample into "pseudobulk" profiles (5 for each cell type), then perform DEG analysis using generalized linear model as implemented in DESeq2 to equally weight each sample and not overcount single cells as independent events
 - CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells in epiR patients show strong upregulation of genes involved in proteasome, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, oxidative phosphorylation, and NOD-like receptor signaling (not seen in mutR patients), so prior to PD-1 blockade CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells in epiR patients were transcriptionally distinct from those in NR patients
 - after PD-1 blockade, activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in epiR patients showed upregulation of genes involved in NOD-like receptor signaling and FA metabolism, mutR-specific downregulation in NK cells after treatment
 - transcriptional profiles of T and NK cell populations in epiR patients are distinct from those of NR and mutR patients, both before and after pembrolizumab treatment
### Activated NK cells are associated with survival in endometrial cancer
 - DEG analyses pointed to enhanced functionality of NK cells in epiR patients compared to NR patients
 - hypothesis: NK cells might be responsible for promoting anti-tumor responses in epiR patients
### Transcriptional signatures of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells in epigenetic MMRd responders are associated with longer survival
## Discussion
 - epiMMRd tumor gene expression of key genes could vary (more than in "static" mutational sense) across cells/time
 - NK cells may play a larger role in epiMMRd anti-tumor response as they can efficiently mount cytotoxic responses in a neoantigen-independent manner (lower tumor mutational burden for epiMMRd than mutMMRd)
# Divergent clonal differentiation trajectories establish CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cell heterogeneity during acute viral infections in humans
## Abstract
 - decrease in human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clonal diversity from acute (days 10-30) to memory phase (days 90-150 for early memory, day 500+ for late memory)
 - clonally biased differentiation trajectories of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in primary responses
 - clonally skewed CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cell differentiation in secondary recall responses
 - gap in field: how do individual T cell clones contribute to heterogeneity (CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to antigen composed of many T cell clones with unique TCRs forming heterogeneous repertoire of effector and memory cells) throughout immune responses?
 - here, they track human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones expanding in response to yellow fever virus vaccination at single cell level, observe drop in clonal diversity from acute to memory phase, suggesting that clonal selection shapes the circulating memory repertoire
## Introduction
 - primary adaptive immune responses lead to clonal expansion of rare, antigen-specific naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and generation of long-lived memory cells that guard against subsequent infections
 - human memory T cell subsets based on CCR7 and CD45RA expression (T<sub>SCM</sub> i.e. stem memory, T<sub>CM</sub> i.e. naive central memory, T<sub>EM</sub> i.e. effector memory, T<sub>EMRA</sub> i.e. effector memory re-expressing CD45RA)
 - T<sub>SCM</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> are naive-like, multipotent, re-establish CD8<sup>+</sup> effector repertoire upon reinfection, and express CCR7, CD127, TCF-1, LEF1, CD27 while T<sub>EM</sub> and T<sub>EMRA</sub> are more similar to activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, are primed cytotoxic effectors that circulate non-lymphoid tissue (first line of defense against subsequent infections), and express granzyme A/B, CD94, and CD57
 - protective roles of these memory T cell subsets is context dependent (i.e. some might be more protective than others against certain infections or tumors)
 - acute infections generate large effector responses, gradually giving rise to more abundant T<sub>CM</sub> or T<sub>SCM</sub> after resolution of the response
 - recurring/chronic infections progressively generate larger T<sub>EM</sub> populations (constant reactivation of existing memory cells)
 - many markers used to characterize CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CCR7, CD45RA, CD27) have continuous rather than strict binary expression patterns (continuum of cell states ranging from naive i.e. Th0 to highly differentiated effector)
## Results
### Clonal diversity in circulating YFV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells drops from acute to memory phase of the response
### Peripheral clonal expansions during the acute response do not predict clonal contributions to the circulating memory T cell repertoire
 - the decline in diversity suggests that clonal selection plays a role in shaping the circulating memory repertoire after vaccination
 - clonal expansion in acute response inversely linked with likelihood of differentiation into long-lived memory T cell clone
### Diverse memory phenotypes emerge after resolution of the acute phase of the response to YFV vaccination
 - virus-specific memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibit wide range of variable cell states rather than discrete identities
### Coupling clonality to cellular identity by scRNA-seq identifies unique clonal origins of long-lived T<sub>EMRA</sub> and T<sub>SCM</sub>
 - track phenotypic evolution of cells from individual T cell clones to understand how CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones contribute to different phenotypes emerging during the acute-to-memory transition
 - clonal fates skewed towards T<sub>SCM</sub> or T<sub>EMRA</sub> phenotype in memory phase
### Individual CCR7<sup>+</sup> T<sub>SCM</sub>, CD127<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub>, and CD127<sup>-</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> memory T cells give rise to distinct effector progeny following secondary reactivation
 - previously thought that T<sub>EM</sub> and T<sub>EMRA</sub> only generate short bursts of highly cytotoxic effector cells
 - see higher PD-1 expression (stronger regulation predisposition) in progeny derived from T<sub>EMRA</sub> compared to T<sub>SCM</sub>
### CD94 and CD62L delineate heterogeneous effector T cell subsets generated in recall responses *in vitro*
### Diverse effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell progeny generated in recall responses to YFV and influenza antigens are composed of distinct T cell clones
# Divergent clonal differentiation trajectories of T cell exhaustion
 - chronic antigen exposure leads to T cell exhaustion with reduced effector function
 - do all antigen-specific T cell clones follow the same T<sub>ex</sub> differentiation trajectory?
 - results: high T cell receptor signaling aviditiy correlates with T<sub>ex</sub> terminal phenotype, low avidity correlates with effector-like T<sub>ex</sub> KLR fate (so higher signaling response from TCR activation leads to higher exhaustion)
# Divergent tumor and immune cell reprogramming underlying immunotherapy response and immune-related adverse events in lung squamos cell carcinoma
 - scRNAseq before/after ICI
 - increased proportions of macrophage subcluster with highly expressed SPP1, tumor tumor cell subclusters in irAE patients
 - TNF signaling pathway conversely associated with treatment efficacy and irAE development in most macrophage and tumor cell subclusters
 - cell-cell communications for TNF ligand-receptor pairs between macrophage/T cells and tumor cells bidirectionally remodeled in responders vs. non-responders and irAE vs. non-irAE patients
 - enhanced macrophage abundance and TNF signaling in on-treatment tumors and organs developing irAEs
 - increased circulating TNF protein in plasma/serum of irAE patients but not ICI responders
 - Th17 abundance didn't change in irAE group, nor was Th17 identified in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumors 
# Dynamics and survival associations of T cell receptor clusters in patients with pleural mesothelioma treated with immunotherapy
## Abstract
 - ICI-enhanced T-cell infiltration and expanded T cell diversity in tumors
 - high number of shared TCR clones between pretreatment tissue and in circulation was associated with improved survival
# Dynamic single cell mapping unveils Epstein-Barr virus-imprinted T cell exhaustion and on-treatment response
## Abstract
 - Epstein-Barr virus associated gastric cancer exhibits an inflammed-immune phenotype, increased T and B cell infiltration
 - immunotherapy triggers clonal revival and reinvigoration of effector T cells
 - antigen-specific ISG-15<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population enriched in Epstein-Barr virus associated gastric cancer patients (transitory exhausted state)
 - baseline intratumoral ISG-15<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells predict immunotherapy responsiveness
 - re-emerged clonotypes of pre-existing ISG-15<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells found after treatment, gives rise to CXCL13-expressing effector population in responsive tumors
 - LAG-3 retention may render ISG-15<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into terminal exhaustion state in non-responsive tumors
 - anti-LAG-3 therapy could reduce tumor burden in refractory patients
## Introduction
 - PD-1 blockade only effective for ~10% of gastric cancer patients
 - Epstein-Barr virus associated gastric cancer is distinct, higher PD-1 blockade effectiveness (~25%)
 - Epstein-Barr virus can trigger T cell responses against abnormal antigens, perhaps leads to PD-1 blockade hypersensitivity as well
## Results
### Patient cohorts and study design
 - 6 male patients with gastric cancer, 3 with Epstein-Barr virus and 3 without, pre and post treatment so 12 samples
# Effective use of latent semantic indexing and computational linguistics in biological and biomedical applications
 - LSI = latent semantic indexing, computational linguistics technique, outperforms Boolean text searches and co-occurrence models at information retrieval, dimensional reduction technique used to compare concepts/topics among collection of terms
 - clustering genes/proteins into GO groups/signaling pathways relies on curation of these groups/pathways, could be supplemented by LSI/LSA (latent semantic analysis)
# Effects of thymic selection of the T cell repertoire on HLA-class I associated control of HIV infection
 - HLA-B57 allele enriched in those with restricted HIV replication without therapy
 - **HLA-B57 restricted T cells are more crossreactive to mutants of target epitopes, this HLA allele also associated with autoimmunity**
# Emerging concepts in T cell receptor specificity: rationalizing and (maybe) predicting outcomes
## Rules are made to be broken and roles are not easily defined
 - example: A6 TCR recognizes HTLV-1 Tax<sub>11-19</sub> peptide presented by MHCI HLA-A*0201, surprisingly strongest interaction in interface is between CDR3α and HLA-A2 (so peptide not involved surprisingly yet TCR is specific not degenerate)
## Rationalizing the specificity/cross-reactivity duality of TCRs
 - a single TCR has been shown to recognize > 1 million peptides
 - crossreactivity is needed as there are many more potential antigens than TCRs
 - hotspots/anchors can be important parts of peptides that must remain more constant for TCR binding, other parts of peptide can vary and allow crossreactivity, hotspots/anchors need not only bind CDRs
# Entropic contributions and the influence of the hydrophobic environment in promiscuous protein-protein association
 - **trying to find evidence for increased hydrophobicity relating to cross-reactivity of TCRs: here they discuss how a particular PKA/AKAP interface demonstrates promiscuity in part due to the number of interactions this hydrophobic interface allows, which allows many alternative contacts (increased entropy, drives forward binding) with other binding partners hence promiscuity**
# Epigenetic regulation of monoallelic rearrangement (allelic exclusion) of antigen receptor genes
## Summary
 - ~10% of genes are expressed monoallelically (any given cell expressed only paternal or maternal allele but not both)
 - **antigen receptor genes in B and T cells are examples of genes expressed in monoallelic manner (allelic exclusion), during lymphocyte development only 1 allele of each antigen receptor undergoes V(D)J recombination at a time (rearrangement of second allele prevented once productive rearrangement of first allele senses)**
## Introduction
 - diploid genome benefits include more robust gene expression patterns, less susceptibility to mutations and environment
 - allelic exclusion benefits: greater cell diversity
 - monoallelic expression can be random (RME, like X inactivation) and non-random (imprinted genes)
 - **allelic exclusion for B and T cells can help prevent autoimmunity (expression of additional functional rearranged subunits from a second allele could lead to multiple specificities for a T or B cell)**
 - **TCRα locus uniquely has rearrangements from both alleles**
# Epigenetic regulation of T cell exhaustion
## Distinct epigenetic programs in T<sub>ex</sub> cells
 - T cells are directed by multiple signals (TCR-antigen interaction, co-stimulatory molecular interactions, local cytokines)
 - in acute infections where antigens can be cleared, most effector cells undergo apoptosis (i.e. they are short-lived effector cells or terminal effector i.e. TE cells, T-bet<sup>high</sup>) while a small fraction persist and differentiate into memory cells via memory precursor (MP, T-bet<sup>low</sup>) cells
 - key effector genes (like *Prf1*, *Gzmb*) demethylated and gain chromatin accessibility upon antigen recognition
 - after pathogen clearance, memory precursor cells can differentiate into long-lived memory cells by demethylating naive-associated genes (*Bcl2*, *Il7r*), demethylated and open chromatin at both effector and naive genes allowing rapid effector responses upon reencountering pathogens
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can become exhausted due to persistent antigen exposure, proliferating less, expressing inhibitory cell receptors (PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM3, LAG3), losing effector function
# Epitope spreading toward wild type melanocyte-lineage antigens rescues suboptimal immune checkpoint blockade responses
## Abstract
 - prior literature: ICI efficacy correlates with load of tumor-specific neoantigens and vitiligo development in patients with melanoma
 - here, they report that patients with low melanoma neoantigen burdens who did respond to ICIs had tumors with higher expression of pigmentation-related genes
 - **expansion of peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations specific for melanocyte antigens observed only in patients who responded to anti-PD-1 therapy, so ICI can promote breakdown of tolerance towards tumor-lineage self-antigens**
 - **mouse model of poorly immunogenic melanomas: skew epitope recognition toward wild type melanocyte antigens associated with improved anti-PD-1 efficacy (can introduce neoantigens with UVB radiation mutagenesis), and got long term protection against engrafted melanomas not sharing neoantigens**
## Results
### Recognition of wild type melanocyte antigens following immune checkpoint blockade in patients with melanoma
 - **immune activity against wild type melanocyte antigens in melanoma may contribute to ICB efficacy despite low neoantigen burden (i.e. perhaps in responders with low neoantigen tumors more often will see irAEs given necessity for immune activity against tumor associated antigens shared between tumor and self)**
## Discussion
 - **neoantigens may contribute to breaking of self-tolerance (toward wild type melanocyte self-antigens) in ICB**
# Evaluating T cell cross-reactivity between tumors and immune-related adverse events with TCR sequencing: pitfalls in interpretations of functional relevance
## Abstract
 - shared T cell clones between tumor and irAE evidence for crossreactivity **(or shared antigens)** underlying irAEs
## Introduction
 - correlation in response rate and irAE development also consistent with crossreactivity hypothesis
 - **crossreactivity here is shared antigen between tumor and self I believe**
## Discussion
 - large number and circulating nature of T cells predispose studies to false positives
# Exceptional response and multisystem autoimmune-like toxicities associated with the same T cell clone in a patient with uveal melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors
## Abstract
 - **identical CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clone found in 4 tissues in a patient with widespread irAEs (duodenum for enteritis irAE, PBMCs, original tumor and liver metastasis responses as well), evidence for crossreactivity underlying irAEs OR common antigen between tumor and self underlying irAEs**
## Discussion
 - tissue-resident memory T cells may underlie irAEs (common in barrier tissue)
 - **duodenitis blocked by antibody to integrin α 4 β 7 (LPAM-1) which blocks T cell infiltraton into GI tract, suggesting that GI toxicity resulted from circulating T cells trafficked to GI tract following expansion elsewhere i.e. in the tumor perhaps**
# Exhaust the exhausters: targeting regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment
 - Tregs can suppress anti-tumor immunity
# Expression of MHC class II in T cells is associated with increased HIV-1 expression
 - CD4 primary HIV-1 infection receptor, expressed on T cells, monocytes, macrophages, DCs
 - MHC class II molecules undetectable on resting T cells, expressed highly on activated T cells, unclear function (vs. clear antigen presentation function on APCs to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells), perhaps also antigen presentation
# Genetic variation associated with thyroid autoimmunity shapes the systemic immune response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade
## Abstract
 - study endocrine irAEs from 7 clinical trials across 6 cancers with PD-1 blockade combined with chemotherapy
 - PD-1 blockade induced thyroid dysfunction associated with longer survival, seen this before not super surprising (irAEs correlating with tumor regression)
# Genetic variation in MHC proteins is associated with T cell receptor expression biases
## Abstract
 - controversy over if germline-encoded TCR-MHC contacts promote TCR-MHC specificity, do differences exist in TCR V gene compatibilities with different MHC alleles?
 - result: *trans* associations between genetic variation and TCR V gene usage in humans
## Introduction
 - HLA genes highly polymorphic, variants associated with many traits, like most autoimmune diseases
 - perhaps different disease risk conferred by particular MHC alleles is due to differences in presented peptides or differences in stabilities of MHC molecules
 - **1-5% of T cells have γ (*TRG*) and δ (*TRD*) chains instead of α (*TRA*) and β (*TRB*) ones, only β and δ chains also have diversity (D) genes recombined in VDJ recombination (α and γ just have VJ recombination)**
 - **during V(D)J recombination, joints between segments are partially digested and nucleotides are randomly added (i.e. N region) to form highly variable and non-germline-encoded complementarity-determining regions 3 (CDR3) loop that recognizes peptides, CDR1/2 loops of TCR form contacts with MHC and are encoded by V genes**
# Genome-wide CRISPR screens of T cell exhaustion identify chromatin remodeling factors that limit T cell persistence
 - chronic stimulation assay
 - *in vivo* validation of screen results (perturbation of INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes improves T cell persistence in tumors)
# Germline variants associated with toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade
## Abstract
 - GWAS of 1,751 patients on ICIs across 12 cancer types
 - 3 genome-wide significant associations: one near *IL7* (regulator of lymphocyte homeostasis) in a new cryptic exon (patients with this variant had increased lymphocyte stability after ICI which predicted irAEs and improved survival), one near *IL22RA1*, and one on 4p15
## Main
 - hypothesis for irAE onset heterogeneity: impact of germline genetic determinants of immune activity
 - evidence for this hypothesis: polygenic risk for autoimmune conditions correlated with onset of cutaneous and thyroid irAEs
## Discussion
 - ***IL7* supports aberrant immune activity in autoimmunity, limits organ toxicity during antiviral immune response, blocks PD-1 leading to T1D (blocking checkpoint when it would have prevented autoimmunity, so IL7 acts as a natural ICB and is therefore rationally associated with irAEs**), can try *IL7* receptor blockade to treat *IL7*-irAEs
# Global analysis of shared T cell specificities in human non-small cell lung cancer enables HLA inference and antigen discovery
## Abstract
 - **cited to say that T cells that crossreact have higher EOMES/KLRG1 (activation markers?)**
 - TILs crossreact to EBV antigens and shared tumor antigens
 - EBV-specific T cells expanded in patients responding to ICB
 - crossreactive CD8 T cells express GZMK
## Introduction
 - in tumors with no known viral etiology, have seen virus-specific (EBV, flu, CMV) TILs, thought to be bystanders (presumed to not recognize tumor antigens, but perhaps they do through crossreactivity)
 - **hundreds to thousands of same TCR can recognize single pMHC**
## Results
### Phenotypic characterization of TMEM161A-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in lung cancer
 - **T cells from tumor-enriched specificity (crossreactive?) group biased towards effector phenotype, express EOMES, KLRG1, GZMK (~activated NK)**
## Discussion
 - **autoreactive T cells in peripheral blood may exist (pruned but not clonally deleted thymus) in order to avoid immunologic "blind spots" to pathogens, i.e. pathogens that look like self would get by free otherwise if we didn't have some autoreactivity perhaps**
 - uncoupling of TCR binding from T cell activation may dampen anti tumor response in tumors
# Graft-versus-host disease versus graft-versus-leukemia
 - graft-versus-host is characterized by robust T cell activation and proliferation followed by infiltration of host target structures
 - it's less clear to what degree T cell activation and proliferation are required for effective graft-versus-leukemia, so perhaps controlling T cell proliferation can uncouple graft-versus-leukemia from graft-versus host
# Guidelines for bioinformatics of single cell sequencing data analysis in Alzheimer's disease: review, recommendation, implementation and application
## Quality control
 - remove sources of technical variation introduced during generation of scRNA data while maintaining true biological variation
 - scRNA is noisier than bulk RNA seq (low amount of RNA/cell, stochastic sampling process of sequencing)
 - many 0 or near-0 counts by "dropout" events
 - common quality control measures are number of expressed features (non-0 count feature detections) and library size (sum of counts across all features)
 - exclude cells with very few expressed features or small library size (low RNA-capture efficiency)
 - also exclude cells with abnormally high numbers of expressed features (doublet/multiplet)
 - lower and upper bounds can vary based on sequencing depth (deeper depth leads to more reads and more detected features irrespective of cell quality)
 - another approach is to remove outliers, for instance removing cells with log-library size greater than 3 median absolute deviations or below median log-library size
 - having a threshold for overall expression content (detected genes) can work to remove doublets, but not all cells contain the same amount of RNA
 - another approach is to look for cells expressing marker genes of > 1 distinct cell type, but this requires knowledge of the cell types and associated markers
 - other approaches include generating artificial doublets by mixing observed gene expression profiles from randomly selected droplet pairs, then embed/dimension reduce and classify to find doublets
 - mitochondrial mapping reads: increased mitochondrial fraction indicates apoptosis, cell stress, and/or loss of cytoplasmic RNA from lysed cells, a threshold of 10% is good for most human tissue although this too can vary (up to 30% is ok for heart muscle cells with their increased energy demand)
 - ambient RNA (from dead/apoptotic cells) can also contribute to noise: this contribution can be estimated by looking at background in "empty" droplets (i.e. droplets of just this ambient RNA), one can also use negative cell markers
## Normalization
 - many biological and technical factors, like sequencing depth, capture efficiency, and cell composition, can all affect observed scRNA read counts
 - normalization targets variance from sequencing (library preparation, high dropout events, amplification bias caused by gene length, GC content, etc.)
 - mitigation of batch effect (variance from experimental design and handling, like different sequencing platforms, timing, reagents, laboratories, etc.)
 - scaling normalization works to correct for sequence depth by dividing feature-level read counts by library size (total read counts within each sample) then multiplying by a constant (like 10,000), then add 1 before log-transforming (to prevent log(0)), but scaling normalization is biased towards highly expressed transcripts
 - other techniques include trimmed mean of M-values (TMM, calculates scaling factors by trimming away genes with extreme fold changes between samples, tends to overcorrect for scaling factors), upper-quantile method (UQ, uses per-sample upper-quantile, 75-th percentile, to scale counts, could be 0 for many cells with low sequencing depth), and relative log-expression (RLE, scales to pseudo-reference derived from geometric mean of gene counts across cells, doesn't work for genes with 0 counts)
 - other methods generally fall into cell-based normalization (estimate cell-specific global size factor to normalize all genes in same cell, pool cells to estimate more robust size factors then deconvolve pooled size factors to get cell-specific size factors) and gene-based normalization (parametric modeling of individual genes, **like Pearson residuals method SCTransform**, perform adjustments individually for each group of genes with different sequencing depths or different ranges of abundance levels)
## Feature selection and dimension reduction
 - identify few latent variables that explain the most variance in data
# FDA approves anti-CD3 antibody to delay type 1 diabetes onset
 - T1D: autoreactive T cells destroy insulin secreting β cells
# Fulminant myocarditis with combination immune checkpoint blockade
## Abstract
 - myocarditis with robust T cell and macrophage infiltrates
 - **selective clonal T cell populations infiltrating myocardium identical to those in tumor and skeletal muscle**
## Discussion
 - possible mechanisms: T cells targeting shared antigen, T cells targeting homologous antigens (different but similar?), T cells targeting dissimilar antigens (what I'm thinking of as crossreactivity)
 - evidence for shared antigen mechanism: high levels of muscle-specific antigens (desmin and troponin) in both patient tumors
# Functionally specialized human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets express physiochemically distinct TCRs
 - **CDR3s of effector/memory Tregs had most hydrophobic and strongly interacting residues which might promote crossreactivity, recapitulated features in naive Tregs suggesting lineage fate predetermined by selection events in thymus, also short CDR3s which might limit crossreactivity**
# Hallmarks of response, resistance, and toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade
## Other immune checkpoints: positive immune regulation
 - ICOS (immune co-stimulator) expressed on T cells, enhances function/expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and Tregs
 - possibly could use ICOS agonist monoclonal antibodies for immunotherapy
## Factors impacting response and resistance to ICB
### Host-intrinsic factors
 - tumor mutational burden (total number of distinct mutations per coding area of tumor genome) helps explain ICB response (higher burden for example in environmental DNA damage associated melanoma, lung/bladder cancer better response with more neoantigens)
## Factors impacting toxcitiy to ICB
### Characteristics of irAEs
# High-throughput and single cell T cell receptor sequencing technologies
## Introduction
 - diversity (D) gene segment only contributes to TCRβ
 - VDJ gene segments, also the constant (C) gene segment
 - recombination of gene segments and non-templated addition or deletion of nucleotides between spliced gene segments (junctions, like CDR1-3 **I think**) generate diverse TCR repertoire
 - complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) is the most diverse, hypervariable
 - unlikely that an individual will have two T cells with the same TCR sequence, so TCR sequences are used as unique identifiers of T cell clones
 - naive T cell repertoire is highly diverse, memory T cells much less so
## Amplification strategies for TCR sequencing
### Multiplex PCR
 - use a pool of primers to bind diverse TCR V genes
 - set of forward primers complementary to all known V genes, set of reverse primers for either J or C regions, depending on if starting with gDNA or cDNA, respectively
### 5' RACE
 - reverse transcribe RNA with enzyme with terminal transferase activity to add untemplated C nucleotides to 3' end of cDNA
 - template switch oligonucleotide (TSO) containing complementary poly(G) stretch anchors to this untemplated region of C nucleotides and allows reverse transcriptase to switch templates and extend cDNA to end of TSO which includes a common adaptor sequence
 - result is that one pair of primers targeting 5' adaptor and constant region is able to amplify all TCR rearrangements
# *HLA-DQA1* and *HLA-DQB1* in Celiac disease predisposition: practical implications of the HLA molecular typing
 - HLA class I and II genes code for cell surface glycoproteins important for antigen presentation and self-recognition by immune cells
 - HLA class I heterodimers consist of α-heavy chain (encoded by *HLA-A/B/C*) and small β-microglobulin
 - HLA class II heterodimers (α and β chains) specified by genes in HLA-D region (*DPA/B1*, *DQA/B1*, *DRB1/A*)
# HLA-dependent variation in SARS-CoV-2 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell crossreactivity with human coronaviruses
## Abstract
 - human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause common cold
 - public TCR repertoires dominated by TCRs cognate to non-homologous SARS-CoV-2 peptides
 - skewed distribution of TCRs cognate to homologous or non-homologous peptides in COVID-19 patients likely HLA-dependent
## Discussion
 - T cells specific to SARS-CoV-2 peptides with high similarity to human CoV predicted pMHC can be expanded from naive indivduals, cognate public TCRs observed in some COVID-19 recovered patients
 - SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals can mount T cell responses to HCoVs that, due to peptide similarity, can be crossreactive with SARS-CoV-2 antigens
 - **certain HLA alleles (HLA‐B*07:02, ‐C*07:02, ‐A*03:01) predispose to SARS‐CoV‐2‐HCoV cross‐reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells**
 - non-specific antiviral immune responses can lead to the release of self-antigens from damaged cells, resulting in bystander activation of autoreactive T cells
 - immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides similar to self antigens may be candidates for autoimmune associations
# HLA-DRB alleles are differentially expressed by tumor cells in breast carcinoma
# Holistic approach to immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events
 - irAEs usually occur within the first months after ICI treatment but can develop as early as after the first dose or as late as years after ICI treatment
 - glucocorticoids are usually used to manage irAEs, other immunosuppressive agents as well
 - CTLA-4 on T cells (mostly CD4<sup>+</sup>) interacts with CD80/86 on antigen presenting cells (outcompetes CD28 for CD80/86), CTLA-4 modulates T<sub>regs</sub> (gatekeepers for prevention of autoimmunity)
 - PD-1 on T cells (mostly CD8<sup>+</sup>) interacts with PD-L1 on tumor cells and antigen presenting cells
 - endocrinopathies (T1D, hypothyroidism) and rheumatological toxicities (arthritis) are most common chronic irAEs
 - **shared antigens between tumor and peripheral normal tissue may drive both antitumor responses and organ-specific autoimmunity, activating tumor/auto-reactive T cells**
 - organ-specific autoantibodies can predict organ-specific irAEs
 - baseline immune cell profiles are being studied as predictors of irAEs: high CD2<sup>low</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> B cells, high eosinophil count, high proliferation of control memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, higher expression of CD27/28 on CD4/8 effector T cells, increased activated CD4 memory T cells and TCR diversity
# Host-specific differences in top-expanded TCR clonotypes correlate with divergent outcomes of anti-PD-L1 treatment in responders versus non-responders
 - murine
# How the thymus designs antigen-specific and self-tolerant T cell receptor sequences
## Introduction
 - **TCRs recognize antigens via multiple modest interactions, so mutations to most amino acids abrogate recognition (conferring specificity)**
 - positive selection is important for MHC restriction but not antigen specificity
 - **past studies: negative selection reduces TCR crossreactivity**
## Results
### Selection against many endogenous pMHC molecules is required for antigen-specific TCR sequences
 - as previously seen
### Negative selection against many peptides results in TCR sequences with peptide contact residues enriched in weakly interacting amino acids
 - when there are many peptides in thymus, CDR3s of TCRs enriched in amino acids that interact weakly with other amino acids, strong interactions in the case where there are few peptides in thymus
# Hydrophobic CDR3 residues promote the development of self-reactive T cells
 - **hydrophobicity at positions 6 and 7 of CDR3 β promote development of self-reactive T cells**
# Identification of neoantigens for individualized cancer immunotherapy
 - neoepitopes are attractive targets for therapeutic cancer vaccines, **but most cancer mutations are unique for individual patients (neoantigenome), requiring individualized treatment**
 - **not all tumor mutations give rise to neoantigens, neoepitope-specific T cells reflect only 1-2% of mutations in an individual tumor, this could be due to not all tumor mutations giving rise to neoantigens and from T cell repertoire not recognizing all neoantigens perhaps as well**
 - **cross-reactivity is possible due to low affinity of functional TCR-pMHC interaction**
 - **heterologous immunity refers to crossreactive T cells induced by unrelated antigen, often pre-existent before tumor onset (like gut microbiota or infections)**
 - **MHC-I encoded in HLA-A/B/C, MHC-II encoded in HLA-DP/DQ/DR**
# Identification of pathogenic immune cell subsets associated with checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis
## Abstract
 - patients with ICI myocarditis have lymphocytic infiltrates in the heart, implicating T cell mediated mechanisms
 - find expansion of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector cells re-expressing CD45RA (Temra CD8<sup>+</sup>> T cells) in ICI myocarditis patients compared to controls
 - these CD8<sup>+</sup> Temra cells were clonally expanded, express proinflammatory cytokines (CCL5/CCL4/CCL4L2), they progress into exhausted phenotype 2 months after treatment with glucocorticoids
## Results
### Analysis of immune cell populations in ICI myocarditis using CyTOF reveals cytotoxic Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> expansion
 - reduction in circulating T/B cells, increase in monocytes/macrophages, increased Tregs, reduced naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, increased Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in ICI-treated groups
 - increased Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in ICI myocarditis vs. other ICI groups
### Global analysis of immune cell populations in ICI myocarditis using scRNA-seq corroborates CyTOF results
 - increase in monocytes, reduction in circulating T cells in ICI-treated groups
### Confirmation of myocarditis-associated Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> expansion by scRNA-seq
 - increase in Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> in ICI-treated groups and in myocarditis group relative to other ICI groups
 - these Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cells expressed high levels of cytotoxicity/activation genes like granzyme B (GZMB), IL-32, CCL5 (chemokine), so they seem cytotoxic
 - don't see unique CD4<sup>+</sup> subpopulation differences
### Single cell TCR sequencing reveals myocarditis-associated clonal expansion of cytotoxic Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cell clusters
 - 83% of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells express α β TCRs, **not sure what the normal/expected frequency is**
 - identify top 50 clonotypes for each patient
 - find expansion of top 50 clonotypes in ICI myocarditis group relative to no ICI and non-myocarditis irAEs (i.e. for myocarditis group the top 50 clonotypes constitute a higher percentage of the CD3<sup>+</sup> cells so they're more expanded)
 - myocarditis expansion mostly in Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cells
 - myocarditis-associated clusters had somewhat high pro-inflammatory and cytotoxicity markers
### Activated and expanded Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> clones in myocarditis transition from an early cytotoxic phenotype to a late exhaustion phenotype over time
 - have data for 1 myocarditis patient for longitudinal study (2 months)
 - persistence of clonally expanded Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in myocarditis patient even after clinical indices of inflammation resolve
 - top 10 clonotypes first belong to Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> but switch to central/effector memory over time
 - early see cytotoxic and chemokine (recruitng immune/inflammatory cells) transcriptomic programs that become attenuated over time, see increase in exhaustion markers over time
### Ligand-receptor analysis of myocarditis-associated T cell populations exhibits interactions with other immune cell types through cardiotropic chemokines
 - use CellPhoneDB algorithm to predict potential ligand-receptor interactions in scRNA-seq data
 - find interactions between ligands expressed by Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cells with members of innate immune system (DCs, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils) via pro-inflammatory crosstalk between CCL5-CCR1 and TNF superfamily members
 - more pro-inflammatory (vs. anti-inflammatory) interactions in ICI-treated groups
 - myocarditis group had lack of key interaction between CD52 and SIGLEC10 (T cell interaction), **also seen lacking in T1D!**
## Discussion
 - they hypothesize that the systemic inflammatory response in ICI myocarditis patients may be greater than that in the relatively milder irAEs in the other group (and in the non-irAE group too), leading to a greater effector T cell expansion in the peripheral blood
 - Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cells previously shown to be expanded in peripheral blood of patients with autoimmune diseases, like RA
 - don't see Th17 effector cell increases in heart as previously seen, although perhaps this is because it was previously seen in autoimmunity vs. irAE?
# Identifying specificity groups in the T cell receptor repertoire
 - TCR sequences are diverse
 - here, they define the minimal requirements for TCR antigen specificity through analysis of TCR sequences using a panel of pMHC tetramer sorted cells and structural data
 - GLIPH algorithm: grouping of lymphocyte interactions by paratrope hotspots, clusters TCRs with high probability of sharing specificity owing to conserved motifs and similarity of CDR3 sequences
# IL7 genetic variation and toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade in patients with melanoma
 - minor allele carries of *Il7* intron have increased severe irAE risk
# Immune dysfunction revealed by digital spatial profiling of immuno-oncology markers in progressive states of renal cell carcinoma and in brain metastases
 - lower immune checkpoint inhibitor (TIM-3, CTLA-4), cytolytic (GZMA, GZMB), and T cell activation (CD25) protein expression in metastases compared with primary tumors
 - metastases macrophages less M1-like, inflammatory markers (HLA-DR, CD127)
# Immune-Related Adverse Events and Their Association With the Effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Real-World Study From China
 - see more antitumor response in irAE group compared to non-irAE group, irAE associated with progression-free survival but not with overall survival
# Immune-related adverse events in checkpoint blockade: observations from human tissue and therapeutic considerations
 - dysregulated cytokines (IFNgamma and TNF) in irAE tissue
 - high T cell infiltration in irAE tissue
 - **PD-1 blockade more CD8 effect, CD4 effect more for CTLA-4 blockade**
 - CD8<sup>+</sup>CXCR3<sup>+</sup> T cells elevated in gastrointestinal, dermatological, and musculoskeletal irAEs
# Immune-related adverse events in various organs caused by checkpoint inhibitors
## Abstract
 - PD-1 receptor on T and B cells, binds PD-L1/2 ligands
 - PD-L1 dominant role in Th1/17 immunity, PD-L2 works mainly in Th2 immunity
## Epidemiology of irAEs
 - irAEs common in skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, endocrine organs, lungs
 - irAEs more common with CTLA-4 blockade than PD-1 blockade
## Mechanisms of irAEs
 - some irAEs have immune counterparts (like thyroiditis and Hashimoto disease, gastrointestinal irAEs and IBD)
 - **irAEs progress more rapidly than autoimmune conditions, also transient often with quick recovery**
## The roles of CTLA-4
 - CTLA-4 expressed on activated T cells, some CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, **CTLA-4 blockade can interfere with T cell differentiation and eliminate Tregs peripherally and in TME**
## The roles of PD-1
 - PD-L1/2 expressed on APCs and in peripheral tissue (PD-L1 expression enhanced with activation stimuli like IFN-γ or IL-17A, PD-L2 mostly induced on APCs by IL-4, higher affinity for receptor than PD-L1)
 - **no antibodies for PD-L2, only PD-L1, in clinical use**
 - PD-L2 has stimulatory and inhibitory effects depending on context
## Differences between CTLA-4 and PD-1
 - **CTLA-4 and PD-1 signaling converge on Akt, regulator of T cell activation, via PI3K antagonization (CD28 activation promotes Akt phosphorylation via PI3K)**
## T cell reactivity in irAEs
 - **CTLA-4 blockade induces more diversified T cells (including autoreactive ones), PD-1 blockade induce more clonal TCR repertoire and proliferation of intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells**
 - **T cells seen infiltrating into irAE tissue, T cells seen targeting irAE tissue seen in blood, so T cells involved in irAEs**
## B cell reactivity in irAEs
 - **ICB induces reduction in circulating B cells, increase in CD21<sup>low</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> memory B cells and plasmablasts that precede and correlate with irAEs**
 - **autoantibodies present ~50% of time for irAEs**
# Immune-related adverse events of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors: a single center experience
 - patients who developed irAEs were younger
# Immune-Related Gene Expression Profiling After PD-1 Blockade in Non–Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Melanoma
 - most patients exhibit partial/complete resistance to PD-1 blockade
 - study patients with various cancers treated with PD-1 blockade
 - **identify 23 immune-related genes/signatures linked to response and progression-free survival**
 - **PD1 gene expression along with 12 signatures tracking CD8 and CD4 T cell activation, natural killer cells, and IFN activation associated significantly with non-progressive disease and progression free survival**
# Immune responses in checkpoint myocarditis across heart, blood, and tumor
## Abstract
 - presence of cardiac-expanded TCRs in a circulating, cycling CD8 T cell population as a novel peripheral biomarker of fatality
## Introduction
 - irAE myocarditis histology: heterogeneous lymphocyte infiltration into myocardium, both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
## Results
### Activated CD8 T cells and CD4 T cells are increased in irMyocarditis
### Immunosuppression alters T cell gene expression but not TCR repertoire in an irMyocarditis case with matched pre- and post-corticosteroid heart samples
### TCR clones enriched in irMyocarditis hearts are distinct from those enriched in tumor
 - across all irMyocarditis patients, five clones were enriched in both heart and tumor (18% of tumor-enriched TCR-βs, 26% of heart-enriched TCR-βs), but in each irMyocarditis patients, the TCR-β clones most expanded in heart tissue compared to control tissue were not enriched in the tumor relative to control tissue
 - **modest overlap of TCR β clones between heart and tumor but majority of enriched/most expanded clones in each tissue are distnct**
## Discussion
 - arguing against shared antigens between heart and tumor, cardiac protein α-myosin autoantigen in mouse models of irMyocarditis but healthy controls here have T cell clones reactive for this antigen in blood (also these were not most expanded clones in irMyocarditis tissue in cancer patients)
# Immune signatures predict development of autoimmune toxicity in patients with cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors
## Highlights
 - systemic immune signatures shortly after ICI start linked to irAEs
 - ICI treated patients with irAEs associated with expansion of Ki-67<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets
 - ICI treated patients with irAEs associated with IFN-γ and IFN-γ-related proteins CXCL9-11 increases
## Summary
 - early increase in CXCL9/CXCL10/CXCL11 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) 1 to 2 weeks after the start of therapy are likely indicators of heightened risk of developing irAEs
 - an early expansion of Ki-67<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells and Ki-67<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is also likely to be associated with increased risk of irAEs
## Results
### The presence of ICI-induced irAEs correlated with improved patient survival
 - irAEs more frequent in treatment responders in both melanoma and NSCLC
### Canonical blood leukocyte frequencies pre-ICI therapy were similar between patients with the same type of cancer, independent of irAE development
### Patients with cancer treated with ICIs developing irAEs showed an early expansion of proliferating T cell subsets
### Patients with expanding CD8<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup> Ki-67<sup>+</sup> T cells were more likely to develop irAEs early in their treatment
### Patients with developing irAEs showed an early increase in the expansion of proteins associated with the IFN-γ signaling pathway
### A potential biomarker profile to predict the development of ICI-irAEs in patients with cancer
 - early treatment expansion of IFN-γ-driven cytokines and of Ki-67<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets provide good prediction model for irAE development (also increase in serum CXCL10), expansion of Ki-67<sup>+</sup> Tregs specifically for melanoma irAEs, CD8<sup>+</sup> Ki-67<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion specifically for NSCLC irAEs
 - IL-10 increase in early treatment associated with reduced irAE risk
## Discussion
 - **they also raise/cite the idea of antigen mimicry between tumor and self antigens, I think this is basically the same idea as the crossreactivity Peter mentioned perhaps underlying irAEs in 10/5/23 meeting (i.e. T cells crossreactive to tumor and self underlie irAEs)**
# Immune tolerance in liver disease
 - incomplete activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (proliferation but then clonal exhaustion or death of T cells)
 - poor CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation (liver APCs express inhibitory cytokines and co-inhibitory ligands)
 - myeloid cells mediate immunosuppression (Kupffer cells are myeloid-derived suppressor cells, promote Treg activation along with DCs)
# Immune tolerance: what is unique about the liver
 - liver continuously exposed to food and microbial antigens from intestine, barrier towards environmental antigens
 - liver also exposed to neoantigens from metabolism
 - risk of immune activation in liver higher than other organs due to these antigen exposures
 - therefore, liver has acquired mechanisms of immune tolerance to avoid overactive immune response
 - liver allografts are accepted across MHC mismatches without immunosuppression due to liver immune tolerance
 - non-liver allografts also rejected less with co-transplantation of liver allograft, **not sure how this induces systemic tolerance but very interesting**
# Immune toxicities elicited by CTLA-4 blockade in cancer patients are associated with early diversification of the T cell repertoire
## Abstract
 - CTLA-4 blockade leads to proliferation of circulating T cells, also clonal expansion of tissue-reactive T cells?
 - **CTLA-4 blockade induced greater diversification of T cell repertoire (more clonotypes including newly detected clones, decreased clonality) in irAE patients compared to no irAE patients**
 - initial broadening in repertoire occured within 2 weeks of treatment preceeding irAE onset
 - irAE patients had more diverse CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but no differences in Tregs
## Introduction
 - **prior work: CTLA-4 blockade promotes remodeling of T cell repertoire (gain and loss of clonotypes but an overall net bias towards gains leading to increased repertoire diversity)**
 - **survival not correlated with generation of new clones but rather with maintenance of pre-existing, high frequency (> 1 in 1,000) clonotypes**
 - **takehome: T cell diversification deleterious via promotion of autoreactivity**
 - **mechanistic model: CTLA-4 blockade induces autoreactivity by mobilizing newly detectable clones, irAE-mediating clones may be enriched within population of activated T cells, distinct from other tissue-specific immunopathologies driven by oligoclonal response to specific antigens like celiac**
## Discussion
 - **with how early TCR diversification is here compared to how late irAEs can develop, TCR repertoire changes can't be the only factor in irAE development**
# Immunogenic correlates of immune-related adverse events for anti-programmed cell death 1 therapy
## Abstract
 - 9,104 patients across 21 cancer types
 - DC abundance strongest correlator with irAE risk, followed by tumor mutational burden, also CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cell abundance
 - also see *IRF4*, *TCL1A* gene predictors
## Discussion
 - relationship between tumor mutational burden and irAE risk: increase in immunogenic neoantigens could resemble peptides in normal tissues (~crossreactivity hypothesis, more neoantigens = more possibly affected self-antigens)
 - perhaps DCs important as potent APC, critical for priming naive T cells, **deficient apoptosis of DCs may increase DC abundance and lead to autoimmunity**
 - **model: intratumoral DCs capture immunogenic neoantigens in tumor microenvironment, migrate to draining lymph nodes, disseminate neoantigens and stimulate resident T cells, educated T cells circulate systemically and induce neoantigen-specific immunopathologies i.e. irAEs against crossreacted self-antigens at distal sites**
# Immunogenicity of somatic mutations in human gastrointestinal cancers
 - tumor-infiltrating leukocytes from 9/10 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers contained CD4<sup>+</sup> and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recognizing 1-3 neo-epitopes from somatic mutations expressed in their own tumors
 - **takehome: surprisingly few neo-epitopes of cancer recognized by immune system, guessing that cancer has many more than 1-3 neo-epitopes, but perhaps I'm mistaken**
# Improved survival with T cell clonotype stability after anti-CTLA-4 treatment in cancer patients
# Abstract
 - **CTLA-4 blockade results in both expansion and loss of T cell clonotypes, global turnover of T cell repertoire**
 - improved survival associated with maintenance of high-frequency clones at baseline
 - stably maintained clonotypes included T cells with high avidity TCRs, like virus-reactive T cells
## Discussion
 - 2 models of effects of CTLA-4 blockade on Teffs: (i) the threshold model whereby CTLA-4 blockade would allow low-avidity T cells to expand and diversity to increase, (ii) the attenuation model whereby CTLA-4 blockade would promote the preferential expansion of high-avidity T cells and narrowing of the repertoire
 - results not really cleanly supporting either model
 - **diverse repertoires are important in limiting the magnitude of immune escape but may also promote self-reactive clones and induce host inflammation**
# Improvement of PD-1 blockade efficacy and elimination of immune-related gastrointestinal adverse effect by mTOR inhibitor
 - ICB induces colitis in melanoma patients, promotes infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells into colitic lesions
 - see PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activated in CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells of colitic lesions
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may already be present in healthy tissues, perhaps why some tissues get more irAEs (more tissue resident immune cells in skin and colon?)
 - alternative hypothesis: shared antigens between tumor and self, tumor infiltrating T cells leak into bloodstream and target self-antigens
# Improving CAR-T immunotherapy: overcoming the challenges of T cell exhaustion
 - **CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) allows modified T cells to mount antigen-specific immune response to cells bearing CAR target antigen independently of MHC**
 - CAR T cell therapy failure often attributed to antigen escape (selection pressure under CAR T surveillance leads to emergence of antigen-negative tumors), but relapse can occur with antigen-positive tumors (can be hard for CAR T cells to access tumor cells for example due to regulatory T cells in tumor secreting inhibitory cytokines)
 - both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can become exhausted
 - T cell inhibitory receptors: PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3, TIGIT, CTLA-4, but several of these inhibitory receptors are upregulated in T cell activation to modulate co-stimulatory signaling (**so inhibitory receptors alone aren't enough to distinguish between exhausted and activated T cells**)
 - targeting TGF-β signaling to help prevent exhaustion: TGF-β is highly expressed in tumor microenvironment and suppresses T cells
# Improving T cell recpetor on-target specificity via structure-guided design
# Incidence of Endocrine Dysfunction Following the Use of Different Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Regimens
 - high incidence of endocrine dysfunction (hypo/hyper-thyroidism) in patients receiving ICI (immune checkpoint inhibitor) regimens, higher with combination therapy
# Induction of neoantigen-specific cytotoxic T cells and construction of T cell receptor co-engineered T cells for ovarian cancer
## Abstract
 - neoantigens implicated as major target of anticancer cytotoxic T cells
 - goal: engineer neoantigen-specific T cells, already able, pilot study to test efficacy here
 - methods to engineer neoantigen-specific TCR: predict neoantigen epitope, synthesize neoantigen peptide, identify neoantigen-specific TCR (hardest part, have to stimulate T cells with peptides), produce virus vector to express TCR
## Introduction
 - tumor regression often achieved by activated cytotoxic T cells targeting neoantigens (mostly generated by nonsynonymous mutations)
 - cytotoxic T cells targeting neoantigens enriched in TILs in patients responding well to TIL infusion therapy (TILs isolated from tumor, expanded, given back to patient)
## Discussion
 - melanoma has highest somatic mutation burden among human cancers (hundreds of neoantigens/patient, 12 mutations/Mb)
 - ovarian cancer has 1 mutation/Mb
 - avoidance of crossreactive T cells (engineering T cells to recognize neoantigen and not WT healthy tissue antigen): **position of amino acid substitution in neoantigen peptide matters as when mutation occurs at anchor position affinity of WT and mutant peptides to HLA are similar**
# Induction of T cell exhaustion by JAK1/3 inhibition in the treatment of alopecia areata
 - alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease caused by T cell-mediated destruction of the hair follicle
 - JAK1/3 inhibitors disrupt γc cytokine signaling (important for T cell development, activation, homeostasis), selectively induces T cell exhaustion to help treat this autoimmune disease
# Inhibitory receptors beyond T cell exhaustion
# Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs): cytokine hubs regulating immunity and tissue homeostasis
 - ILCs enriched at mucosal barriers, activated by stress signals and epithelial/myeloid-derived cytokines, respond by secreting effector cytokines to maintain survival and mucosal integrity
 - ILCs do not possess rearranged antigen-specific cell receptors (TCR/BCR) but they mirror T helper cell diversity regarding cytokine secretion and transcription factors regulating differentiation
 - ILCs express cytokine receptor γ chain with IL-7 receptor(R)α (CD127)
# Insight into immune profile associated with vitiligo onset and anti-tumoral response in melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy
## Abstract
 - **they usually find different TCR sequences in vitiligo and primary melanoma lesions, so T cell response against normal melanocytes leading to vitiligo is not usually mediated by reactivation of T cell clones infiltrating/specific to primary melanoma but rather perhaps by T cells targeting metastatic tissues, so kind of different from my thinking of usually crossreactivity between primary tumor and irAE site but could also be crossreactivity between metastases and irAE sites**
## Introduction
 - vitiligo irAE really better called a leukoderma lesion but very similar to spontaneous vitiligo (histology ~same)
## Results
### Patients who developed vitiligo during immunotherapy have a diverse frequency of circulating immune cells
 - 12 ICB responder patients
 - reduction of circulating CD8-mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT), T helper (Th)-17, and T-reg cells associated with vitiligo onset
 - reduction in natural killer (NK) CD56<sup>bright</sup> cell frequency was detected during treatment in both patient groups, suggesting an association with a positive clinical response
 - reduction in frequency of PD-1 expressing CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, Th1, Th1/17 cells in all patients, moreso for those not developing vitiligo
### T cells infiltrating immunotherapy-induced vitiligo share V(D)J rearrangements with T cells infiltrating metastasis lesions and primary melanomas
 - TRB CD3 sequencing on vitiligo biopsies, also do TCR-seq on PBMCs
 - **metastasis and vitiligo sample TCRs more similar than primary melanoma and vitiligo TCRs**
 - see shared TCR clonotypes betwen melanoma and metastasis
 - metastasis TCRs most diverse, followed by PBCMs, then vitiligo, then lastly primary tumor (most clonal TCRs)
## Discussion
 - vitiligo caused by oxidative stress of melanocytes (ROS release by stressed melanocytes), leading to innate immune activation (DCs recognize damage-associated molecules) which stimulates anti-melanocyte adaptive immunity (autoreactive T cells, enhanced by impaired Tregs)
 - TCRs generally different in vitiligo lesions and primary melanoma, **TCRs more often shared between vitiligo and metastases vs. vitiligo and primary tumor**
 - **"beneficial autoimmunity": shared TCRs recognizing tumor-associated antigens in vitiligo and metastatic lesions of positive responders**
# Integrated analysis of multimodal single cell data
 - weighted nearest neighbor analysis integrates multimodal single cell data in an unsupervised manner by learning relative utility of each data type in each cell
# Integrated NY-ESO-1 antibody and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses correlate with clinical benefit in advanced melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab
 - isotype control: primary antibody that lacks specificity to target but matches class/type of primary antibody used, negative control to see non-specific background signal
 - CTLA-4 blockade improves survival in patients with advanced melanoma, also enhances immunity to NY-ESO-1 (cancer-testis antigen expressed in some melanoma patients)
 - see increase (16% to 22%) in seropositivity for NY-ESO-1 antibody after CTLA-4 blockade, seropositive individuals more likely to experience clinical benefit (seropositive individuals who didn't experience clinical benefit more likely didn't have associated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells)
# Interpreting T cell crossreactivity through structure: implications for TCR-based cancer immunotherapy
## Abstract
 - melanoma-specific T cells crossreacting with healthy heart/nervous tissue, crossreactivity
 - **crossreactivity driven by structural similarities of seemingly unrelated pMHCs (by sequence)**
 - **"hot-spots" for crossreactivity, some residues more important than others for allowing/triggering crossreactivity**
## Hypothesis and theory
 - **there are biases in somatic recombination process, so some TCRs are produced more often than others (leading to public TCRs)**
 - **it's uncommon for two different MHCs to be able to bind a given peptide, but crossreactivity involving different MHCs has been reported**
 - **MHC binding importance in TCR-pMHC interaction is one of causes of allogenic transplant rejection**
 - **TCR has flexible loops (including CDRs) that interact with pMHC**
 - **α CDRs usually bind N-terminus of peptide, β CDRs bind C-terminus**
 - **TCR footprint: general docking mode of TCR to cognate pMHC, germline bias i.e. TCR recognizes conserved MHC residues**
# Interesting possibilities to improve the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab (Yervoy)
 - target ICI to tumor with streptavidin-biotin technology (anti-tumor antibody conjugated to streptavidin and biotin-labeled anti-CTLA-4 antibody for example)
# Intratumoral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells mediate anti-tumor cytotoxicity in human bladder cancer
## Abstract
 - scRNAseq and paired TCRseq of 7 patients, bladder tumor and non-malignant tissue
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells similar in tumors and non-malignant tissue, but CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have tumor-specific states (including Tregs)
 - **find cytotoxic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expanded, can kill tumors in MHC class-II dependent fashion and are suppressed by Tregs**
## Results
### Tregs are clonally expanded in bladder tumors
 - CD4<sup>+</sup> TCR repertoire more restricted (less diverse) in TME (~11% unique clonotypes shared by > 1 cell) than in adjacent non-malignant tissue (~5% unique clonotypes shared by > 1 cell)
 - **restricted repertoire in TME due to expansion of Tregs**
## Discussion
 - origin of cytotoxic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells: doesn't seem to arise from Tregs (no clonotype sharing), perhaps from other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (shared clones)
# Intratumoral expression levels of *PD-L1*, *GZMA*, and *HLA-A* along with oligoclonal T cell expansion associate with response to nivolumab in metastatic melanoma
 - *PD-L2* expression levels also correlate with response to nivolumab
 - Th1 response dominance in responders (higher *TBX21/GATA3* ratio)
 - see oligoclonal T cell expansion in responders' TILs
# Intratumoral heterogeneity and T cell exhaustion in primary CNS lymphoma
# Inverse vaccination, the opposite of Jenner's concept, for therapy of autoimmunity
 - Jenner invented vaccination in 1796
 - autoimmunity treatment includes immunosuppression via anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (B cells marked by CD20), anti-CD52 mAb (WBCs marked by CD52), similarly reduce transplant rejection with mAbs against CD3 (T cells marked by CD3), can also disrupt lymphocyte ingress into tissue via integrin blockade or impeded egress of lymphocytes out of lymph nodes via spingosine phosphate receptor modulation

## Abstract
 - scRNAseq + TCR-seq of tumor, normal, and lymph tissue in patients with lung cancer after ICI
 - cancer cells enriched for exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>regs</sub>, follicular CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells
 - the exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> tumor-specific T cells and follicular T helper cells were clonally linked to TCF7<sup>+</sup> SELL<sup>+</sup> progenitors in tumor draining lymph nodes
## Introduction
 - ICI can work via activation, expansion, and recruitment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from peripheral circulation
 - open questions: are there phenotypic differences between clonally related T cells in different anatomical sites? are progenitor exhausted T cells clonally linked to intratumoral exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells present in tumor-draining lymph nodes (seems to be the case in mice)? how long do tumor specific T cell clones like exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells persist after ICI?
## Results
### Clinical and pathological characteristics of lung cancer resections after ICB
### Multi-regional scRNA/TCR-seq of the T cell response to NSCLC
 - scRNA/TCR-seq on sorted CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - see minimal TCR overlap between 3 patients
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters contain larger clones than CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters
 - TCR repertoire most diverse in lymph node regions, greater clonal enrichment in tumor regions
### Exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and follicular helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are enriched in tumor regions with viable cancer cells
 - are certain specific T cell phenotypes enriched in regions containing viable tumor cells?
 - see lymph nodes enriched for naive and TCF1 CD8 T cells, adjacent normal regions enriched for effector CD8 T cells
 - exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters enriched in tumor regions
 - enriched naive, Treg, and follicular helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in lymph nodes, effector CD4 T cells enriched n adjacent normal regions, CD4 Tregs and follicular helper T cells enriched in tumor
### Transcriptional signatures of progressive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion across organs
# Liver mediated adaptive immune tolerance
 - liver is immunologically tolerant, equipped to limit hypersensitivity to food-derived antigens, bacterial products, can easily accept allografts
 - persistent infection of liver with pathogen usually results in tolerance
 - immunosuppressive environment of liver makes adaptive immune cells of liver readily tolerogenic, promoting death of effector cells (also anergy, senescence, exhaustion) and "education" of regulatory cells
 - tolerance mechanisms of liver related to many liver diseases
 - liver is the largest organ with a rich blood supply (hepatic artery, portal vein), exposed to many microbial products, harmless food-derived antigens via intestines
# Low-dose ipilimumab plus nivolumab combined with IL-2 and hyperthermia in cancer patients with advanced disease: exploratory findings of a case series of 131 stage IV cancers - a retrospective study of a single institution
 - hypothesis: reduce irAEs with hyperthermia to increase numbers of effector lymphocytes
 - irAEs similar to an auto-graft vs. host disease reactions following allogenic bone marrow transplantation
 - perhaps try lower dose of ICIs
# Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II proteins: conformational plasticity in antigen presentation
 - APC presented peptides are generated from proteins produced by cell's own translational machinery or from proteins funneled into endo-lysosomal vesicular system
 - peptide repertoire presented by MHC proteins largely depends on structural features of binding groove of each particular MHC allelic variant
 - tapasin (for class I) and HLA-DM (for class II) are peptide editors that contribute to shaping of presented peptidome by favoring binding of high-affinity antigens
 - some MHC allelic variants are more susceptible to peptide editing than others, not well understood
 - peptide-MHC class I complexes are presented on all nucleated cells and are recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - pMHCII presentation by APCs (DCs, macrophages, B cells) activates CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, leading to coordination and regulation of effector cells
 - MHC binding platform composed of 2 domains from single heavy α-chain (HC) for MHCI and from two chains for MHCII (α-chain and β-chain), 2 domains form β-sheet as base and 2 α-helices on top that have space between them to accommodate a peptide chain
 - 2 membrane-proximal immunoglobulin domains support peptide-binding unit
 - MHCI binding groove can accomodate ~8-10 residue peptide, ~13-25 residue peptide for MHCII
# Mechanisms and biomarkers of immune-related adverse events in gastric cancer
 - blocking CTLA-4 can induce activation of autoreactive T ells via depletion of Tregs (express CTLA-4), stimulation of B cells to produce autoantibodies
 - blocking CTLA-4/PD-1 may lead to expansion and activation of pre-existing tissue-resident memory T cells
 - irAE biomarkers in gastric cancer: HLA-DR15 (higher with irAEs, perhaps via IL-17), neutrophil/platelet to lymphocyte ratios (NLR, PLR, inflammatory markers of poor prognosis and irAE development)
 - managing irAEs: corticosteroids/immunosuppression
# Mechanisms of immune-related adverse events during the treatment of cancer with immune checkpoint inhibitors
## Abstract
 - mechanisms leading to irAEs are likely similar to those promoting anti-tumor responses (expansion of T cell repertoire)
 - **ICB can affect B cell responses and induce autoantibody production**
## Introduction
### Checkpoint inhibitors
 - CTLA-4 blockade leads to more irAEs than anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1
 - irAEs may depend on age (older patients perhaps more at risk due to age-related immune changes), sex, pre-existing autoimmune disease, prior anti-cancer treatment, and microbiome composition
 - irAE occurence likely associated with improved tumor response
### The mechanisms of ICIs
 - T cell activation requires TCR recognition of antigen and co-stimulation (CD28 from T cell interacting with CD80/86 on APCs)
 - both B cells and tumor cells may express PD-L1
 - **CTLA-4 (~30% homologous with CD28) expression induced on T cells following their activation (CTLA-4 also expressed on Tregs)**, CTLA-4 outcompetes CD28 for CD80/86 and the **CTLA-4-CD80/86 interaction decreases T cell-mediated immune responses by reducing IL-2 and IL-2 receptor expression**
 - anti-CTLA-4 antibodies can eliminate Tregs in tumor microenvironment via Fc-receptor-mediated interactions, **not sure what this is**
 - **activation of peripheral T cells and B cells induces PD-1 expression to maintain peripheral tolerance**
 - PD-L1 (on resting B cells, T cells, macrophages, DCs) and PD-L2 (sometimes on resting immune cells, induced by proinflammatory cytokines) are PD-1 ligands
 - CTLA-4/PD-1 signaling converge on Akt (regulates metabolism, apoptosis, proliferation); PD-1 signaling antagonizes PI3K directly while CTLA-4's effects occur via PP2A phosphatase
 - **Anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies called "immune enhancers" and "immune normalizers" (normalizing T cell immunity in tumor microenvironment), respectively, consistent with PD-1 blockade having less irAEs**
### Mechanisms of T cell reactivity in irAEs
 - CTLA-4 blockade can lead to higher TCR V-β CDR3 diversity in patients with irAEs, doesn't seem to matter though for clinical response, **which may suggest distinct autoreactive and anti-tumor populations**
 - **irAEs may arise from mobilization of large numbers of T cells, some of which are autoreactive**
 - lag time between early changes in T cell populations upon ICI and development of irAEs later, perhaps **pathogenic T cells gradually emerge from larger number of clonotypes that occur after ICI**
### Mechanisms of B cell reactivity in irAEs
 - advanced melanoma patients receiving combination ICI had decreased circulating B cell counts, increased CXCL13 (germinal center activation marker) plasma levels, increased B cell clonality (in terms of immunoglobulin gene expression), and increased plasmablasts after treatment, and early changes in B cells correlated with higher rates of severe irAEs
 - subset of CD21<sup>low</sup> memory B cells particularly affected by combination ICI with restricted PD-1 expression and increased IFN-γ signaling after treatment
### Pre-existing autoimmune disease and immune checkpoint therapy
 - ICIs can flare underlying autoimmune disease
### Immunosuppression and tumor response
 - **lower response rate to anti-PD-1 therapy if on immunosuppressive therapy at treatment onset (i.e. for pre-existing autoimmune disease)**
# Mechanisms of T cell exhaustion guiding next generation immunotherapy
 - resting exhausted T cells in antigen-free environments doesn't reinvigorate them (exhaustion is a committed cell fate)
 - exhausted T cells, unlike functional memory T cells, do not exhibit antigen-independent homeostatic proliferation (self-renewal in presence of homeostatic cytokines IL-7, IL-15); exhausted T cells require antigen exposure for maintenance
 - key transcription factors involved in T cell exhaustion include BATF, IRF4, c-Jun (**c-Jun OE prevents exhaustion**), NR4A, **EOMES (I see this pop up often in papers**), TOX, and NFATC1
 - ICI is most effective when applied when antigen-specific T cells are not yet exhausted, **here, they say that ICI doesn't reprogram T cells away from exhausted state, although I feel like I've seen papers that say it does, perhaps before they are committed to exhaustion they can be recovered with ICI?**
 - exhausted fate exhibits a unique epigenetic profile, DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A adds repressive DNA methyl marks (DNMT3A KO T CD8 T cells maintain ability to respond to ICI despite chronic antigen exposure); SUV39H1, LSD1, and TET2 are other critical epigenetic regulators of T cell fate
 - path to exhaustion is a continuum, some precursor exhausted T cells can self-renew, TCF1<sup>+</sup> (express TCF7)
 - most CAR T cell protocols use a heterogeneous starting population of bulk CD4 and CD8 T cells spanning developmental potential range, but more plastic memory T cells (T<sub>cm</sub> i.e. central memory T cells and T<sub>scm</sub> i.e. stem cell memory T cells) possess greater effector/proliferative capacities and better eradicate tumors when used as CAR T cell starting populations
 - patients eligible for CAR T cell therapy usually have relapsed/refractory (treatment-resistant), so their T cells have likely been chronically antigen exposed, as well as exposed to chemotherapy (skews T cells towards more terminally differentiated effector memory i.e. T<sub>em</sub> cells), and this all makes the CAR T therapy less effective (than if it had been used at the beginning)
# MHC-II alleles shape the CDR3 repertoires of conventional and regulatory naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - **H2-A<sup>j</sup> favors selection of narrower and more hydrophobic CDR3 repertoire compared to H2-A<sup>b</sub> in mice**
# MHC class II (DRB) promoter polymorphism and its role in parasite control among malaria patients
# MHC class II tetramers
 - can interrogate CD4 T cells using soluble MHC II tetramers
### Tetramer assay/stain
 - use tetrameric MHCs to detect and quantify T cells specific for given antigen within sample
 - tetramer = 4 MHCs that present a specific peptide
 - use to find T cells with receptors that match that peptide
 - tetramers labeled with fluorophore, tetramer-bound T cells analyzed by flow cytometry
 - use tetramers as monomers don't have high enough affinity (MHC tetramer can bind more than 1 receptor on target T cell, increasing binding strength)
#### CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - CD8 coreceptors bind MHC class I molecules
 - most cells express MHC class I, process intracellular antigens and present them
 - class I MHC made of polymorphic α heavy chain and invariant light β 2 microglobulin
#### CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - CD4 coreceptors bind class II MHC molecules
 - class II MHC molecules expressed by APCs like DCs, macrophages
# Mismatch repair deficiency is not sufficient to elicit tumor immunogenicity
## Abstract
 - DNA mismatch repair deficiency is associated with high tumor mutational burden and ICB sensitivity, but most mismatch repair deficient tumors are not responsive to ICB
 - intratumor mutational heterogeneity impedes T cell infiltration and ICB response
## Main
 - intratumor mutational heterogeneity refers to the fraction of mutations that are subclonal (only present in a minority of tumor cells), **so i.e. with a very mutationally heterogeneous tumor maybe there's a good immune response against a portion of the tumor but there's many other subclones that are not recognized by the immune system, i.e. subclones could be deleted with minimal impact on tumor fitness**
# Mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability-high as a predictor for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy efficacy
 - microsatellite instability-high follows mismatch repair deficiency
 - mismatch repair deficiency represents a good prognosis in early colorectal cancer but a poor prognosis in patients with metastasis (**perhaps because it's more easily recognized by immune system but it's a double edged sword as it's also likely more cancerous and dangerous at metastasis stage**)
# Mismatch repair deficiency predicts response of solid tumors to PD-1 blockade
 - cancers deficient in mismatch repair (MMR) have high mutation burden, seems to be a good predictor of response to PD-1 blockade
 - **many mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair-deficient cancers makes them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of cancer's tissue of origin**
 - show that ICI induces peripheral expansion of tumor-specific T cells and that mismatch repair-deficient tumors harbor functional MANA (mutation-associated neoantigens) specific T cells
 - TCR-seq works by CDR3 sequencing (most variable region of TCRα and β chains, governs interactions with peptide-MHC complexes, junction between V and J or D and J genes)
# Molecular mechanisms of cutaneous immune-related adverse events (irAEs) induced by immune checkpoint blockade
## The biological function of immune checkpoints
### CTLA-4
 - CD28 homolog (with higher affinity for ligands than CD28) mostly expressed by activated T cells, constitutively expressed on Tregs
 - CTLA-4 ligands CD80/86 mostly on APCs
 - attenuates T cell activation to reduce immune responses to weak antigens (like self/tumor)
 - CTLA-4 expression in Tregs downregulates immune responses to maintain self-tolerance by inhibiting effector T cell proliferation and cytokine release
### PD-1
 - CD279, expressed by activated T cells, B cells, NKs, some myeloid cells
 - contributes to peripheral tolerance by binding ligands PD-L1 (CD274, B7-H1) or PD-L2 (CD273, B7-DC) on APCs (macrophages, DCs, some B cells)
 - PD-L1 expression induced in APCs by interferon and IL-17, PD-L2 expression stimulated by IL-4
### LAG-3
 - CD223
 - expressed by activated T cells, NKs, Tregs, B cells, DCs
 - **MHC II is primary LAG-3 ligand, higher affinity between LAG-3:MHC II than CD4:MHC II, so LAG-3 may downregulate T cell function by competing with CD4**
## Subtypes and possible mechanisms of cutaneous immune-related adverse events
 - type IV hypersensitivity reactions
 - genetic differences in HLA variants
 - increased proinflammatory cytokines
 - **autoreactive cytotoxic T cells against common antigens**, specifically for vitiligo-like depigmentation, Lichenoid eruption, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis
 - innate immunity
 - Th17 pathway activation
 - T cell (in)dependent humoral immunity
# Molecular mimicry and autoimmunity
## Highlights & abstract
 - molecular mimicry occurs when similarities between foreign and self-peptides leads to activation of autoreactive leukocytes by foreign antigens, can be deleterious or may help induce immune tolerance, **how?**
 - other mechanisms for autoimmunity besides molecular mimicry: breach in central tolerance, non-specific bystander activation, persistent antigenic stimuli
## Molecular mimicry and autoimmune diseases
 - criteria for molecular mimicry: similarity between self and foreign epitopes, antibodies or T cells that crossreact with both epitopes (foreign and self), link between exposure to foreign antigen and development of autoimmune disease, reproducibility of autoimmunity in animal model following sensitization with foreign epitopes
 - types of molecular mimicry: complete identity sharing at protein level, homology at protein level, common/similar amino acid sequences/epitopes, structural similarities
## Molecular mimicry and cross-reactivity: what is necessary?
 - cross-reactivity was at first expected to be low, but **only a small portion of an antigen is needed to be recognized by a TCR (8-10 amino acids for MHCI, 14-18 for MHCII, does this mean that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells might be more cross-reactive?**)
 - TCRs have specificity for MHC bearing peptide (MHC restriction)
 - there are anchor residues (critical residues of peptide required to bind specific MHC), but there are plastic residues as well, leading to polyspecificity
 - **chimera TCRs with 2 β or 2 α (and 1 of the other) could also lead to cross-reactivity with different specificities (perhaps different α-β pairs on same T cell have different specificities)**
# Molecular mimicry between tumor associated antigens and microbiota-derived epitopes
 - three cases of 100% homology between tumor associated antigens and microbiota-derived antigens of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla (> 90% of gut microbiota)
 - likely induction of crossreactive T CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, so anti-microbiota T cell memory could serve as anti-cancer T cell memory
 - **biological significance may depend on when individuals encounter microbiota species with antigens similar to tumor: early in life would mean that immune system could recognize antigens as self and that specific T cell clones would be removed (s tumor presenting homologous TAA would have an advantage), but if microbiota colonizes gut later in life the immune system could recognize peptide as non-self and then tumor would be exposed to specific memory T cells**
# mTOR regulates T cell exhaustion and PD-1-targeted immunotherapy response during chronic viral infection
 - background: PD-1-blockade enhances T cell response by promoting differentiation of stem-like T cells towards TIM3<sup>+</sup> cells
 - results: blocking mTOR during T cell expansion enhances T cell response (stem-like T cells accumulate), but blocking mTOR after exhaustion has progressed causes immunosuppression (decreased TIM3<sup>+</sup> cells, increased viral load)
# Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are activated in the gastrointestinal tissue of patients with combination ipilumumab and nivolumab therapy-related colitis in a pathology distinct from ulcerative colitis
 - irAE colitis: see activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and (granzyme B<sup>+</sup>) MAITs, not seen in ulcerative colitis
 - ICB induces increase in peripheral activated memory CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells regardless of colitis irAE
 - low baseline circulating MAITs associated with irAE colitis
# Multi-omics prediction of immune-related adverse events during checkpoint immunotherapy
## Introduction
 - pneumonitis is the most common fatal irAE (10% death rate), myocarditis is the most lethal irAE (~50% mortality)
 - TCR diversity, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clonal expansion, tumor mutational burden predict irAEs
## Discussion
 - *LCP1* and *ADPGK* are genes related to T cell activation that predict irAEs
# Multiple instance learning to predict immune checkpoint blockade efficacy using neoantigen candidates
 - predict ICB efficacy using neoantigen features (machine learning) to improve general imperfect prediction of ICB response from neoantigen load
 - SNV-derived neoantigens better predictor perhaps, not those from fusion genes, also those from indels seems to predict ICB response perhaps
# Multiple rearrangements in T cell receptor α chain genes maximize the production of useful thymocytes
 - allelic exclusion conventional for TCR β
 - TCR α expression less strictly regulated, endogenous TCR α chains often found in association with transgenic TCR β chains in transgenic mice
 - TCR α may make multiple rearrangements on each chromosome
# Negative binomial additive model for RNA-Seq data analysis
## Methods for differential expression analysis
 - DESeq2, edgeR (based on negative binomial regression to model gene counts)
 - voom (based on empirical Bayes model)
 - BBSeq, based on β-binomial regression model
# Neoantigens: promising targets for cancer therapy
## Abstract
 - neoantigens come from mutations, dysregulated RNA splicing, disordered PTMs, and integrated viral ORFs (in the cases of viral cancers like HPV and EBV, called oncoviral antigens)
## Introduction
 - tumor vaccines can be used to improve antigen presentation
 - tumor associated antigens exhibit abnormal expression in tumors, limited expression in normal tissue (like overexpressed proteins, lineage-specific differentiation markers), but as these tumor associated antigens are non-mutated self-antigens central tolerance mechanisms may prevent effective immune responses
## The source of neoantigens
 - MHC-I presentation pathway: intracellular cytosolic (neo)antigens are processed in proteasome, transported into ER (via TAP), loaded onto MHC in ER, then pMHC complexes are transported to cell surface in vesicles
 - MHC-II presentation pathway: extracellular (neo)antigens are endocytosed, processed in endosome, loaded onto MHC in endosome, then pMHC complexes are transported to cell surface in vesicles
# Network-based machine learning approach to predict immunotherapy response in cancer patients
 - tumor mutation burden improves model
# New biomarkers exploration and nomogram construction of prognostic and immune-related adverse events of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors
## Abstract
 - CD3<sup>+</sup> CD56<sup>+</sup> CD16<sup>+</sup> NKT-like cells correlated with progression free survival and severe irAE development in NSCLC patients receiving ICI
 - also see higher CD4<sup>+</sup>:CD8<sup>+</sup> ratio associated with severe irAEs
## Discussion
 - PD-L1 expression is the most heavily studied biomarker, problematic due to spatial heterogeneity in expression
# New epigenetic regulators of T cell exhaustion
 - summary of Belk et al.'s *in vitro* CRISPR screen (chronic antigen stimulation model using antibody agonist for TCR over 10 days) to identify genes that regulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion
 - epigenetic modulating genes related to T cell exhaustion
 - eliminating *Arid1a* (chromatin modifier) allows CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to retain proliferative and cytotoxic functions *in vivo*
 - **this summary does state that ICI restores some functions of exhausted T cells, so again I'm not sure if ICI can reprogram exhausted T cells or not, likely depends on how terminally committed they are to exhaustion**
# Nivolumab in resected and unresectable metastatic melanoma: characteristics of immune-related adverse events and association with outcomes
 - irAEs in 68% of patients (mostly not severe)
 - **difference in overall survival between those with and without irAEs, irAEs incidence correlate with increase overall survival**
# NK-cell exhaustion, B-cell exhaustion, and T cell exhaustion - the differences and similarities
 - exhaustion is not the same as anergy (senescence and suppression)
 - exhaustion: impaired state, progressive loss of functionalities, reduced proliferative capacity, triggered by chronic antigen stimulation (chronic infection, cancer)
 - anergy: also an impaired state but from inadequate activating receptor stimualtion, hyporesponsiveness, no proliferation, defective production of major growth factors/inflammatory cytokines following antigen encounter
 - senescence: also an impaired state but from aging, permanent G1 arrest, restricts life span of cells to control replication, results from oncogene activation, telomere degradation, epigenetic changes, ionizing radiation; senescent cells remain viable, often secrete proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases (proteinases) in a state called SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype)
 - suppression: also an impaired state but from inhibition by non-antigenic factors, dysfunction caused by hypoxia, neuroendocrine activation (cortisol, glucocorticoids), hypercoagulable blood state (increased tissue factor, fibrin, thrombin, platelet activation), pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (E2), anti-inflammatory phase factors (IL-6, Il-10), transforming growth factor (TGF) β1, T<sub>regs</sub>
 - NKs are part of the innate immune system but are similar to cytotoxic T cells, they lack antigen specificity and are usually short-lived (< 10 days), so their exhaustion is likely less important
 - there are long-lived, somewhat antigen-specific NKs with memory recall though
 - B cell exhaustion: weaker antibody response (inhibited normal function)
# Ocular adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, a scoping review
 - they suggest irAEs can be broken into 2 categories: true irAEs (T cells activated against tumor and normal cells, theoretically this wanes after ICBs are stopped) and induction/exacerbation of paraneoplastic syndromes triggered by ICB (remote effects of cancer not caused by tumor/metastases, like immune response against tumor with cross-reaction of antibodies between tumor and self), **I don't really understand the difference between these two types here**
# On the specificity of protein-protein interactions in the context of disorder
 - **trying to find evidence for relation between hydrophobicity and cross-reactivity: bring up idea of transcriptional (co)activators being non-specific due to hydrophobicity, and negative charge (perhaps unhelpful with negatively charged DNA)**
# Patient HLA class I genotype influences cancer response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy
## Abstract
 - HLA-I loci heterozygosity associated with better survival (3 major HLA-I genes: A-C)
 - HLA-B44 supertype also associated with better survival, HLA-B62 supertype associated with worse survival
## Main
 - **each HLA-I variant binds a select repertoire of peptide ligands, so HLA-I heterozygosity may increase diversity of peptides presented to T cells**
# PD-1 blockade induces responses by inhibiting adaptive immune resistance
 - adaptive immune resistance: upregulation of PD-L1 on cancer tissues, interaction with PD-1 on antigen-specific CD8 T cells
 - here, show that pre-existing CD8 T cells on tumor margin associated with expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and may predict response to therapy
 - responding patients showed proliferation of intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - pre-treatment samples from responders show higher numbers of CD8, PD-1, PD-L1 expressing cells at invasive tumor margin and inside tumors, more **clonal TCR repertoire**
# PD-1 blockade in tumors with mismatch-repair deficiency
 - mismatch repair deficiency status predicts clinical benefit of ICI (ICI works better with tumors with mismatch repair deficiency)
 - **immune infiltrate associated with mismatch repair-deficient carcinomas directed at neoantigens**
# Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets predict the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer
 - high CD4<sup>+<sup>CD45RA<sup>-</sup> T cell and low CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte associated with better ICI prognosis
 - CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells higher in patients with irAEs
 - CD8<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup>T cell associated with irAEs
# Peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes predict the efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in cancer patients
 - CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> T cell level associated with ICI efficacy but also irAE development
# Peripheral T cell expansion predicts tumor infiltration and clinical response
## Abstract
 - clonotypic expansion of effector-like T cells within tumor and in normal adjacent tissue, associated with ICB response
 - expanded clonotypes in tumor and normal adjacent tissue can be detected in peripheral blood
 - intratumoral T cells are replaced with fresh, non-exhausted cells from outside the tumor, especially in responsive patients
 - **non-exhausted T cells from periphery may be key in explaining ICB response**
## Main
 - parallel expansion in tumor and normal adjacent tissue may be from infiltration of T cells from periphery (extravasating into both tumor and normal adjacent tissue from blood)
# Potentiating local and abscopal antitumor efficacy through radiation with FAP-CD40 DARPin and anti-PD1 therapy
 - ~70% of patients develop resistance to ICI
 - CD40: costimulatory molecule that drives DCs and TAMs (tumor associated macrophages) to prime T cells
 - FAP: fibroblast activation protein, upregulated in tumor in response to radiation (which can be taken advantage of for drug delivery to TME via FAP-CD40 DARPin)
 - FAP-CD40 DARPin: uses FAP and CD40 binding domains to cross-link and activate CD40 specifically in tumor
# Quantifiable predictive features define epitope-specific T cell receptor repertoires
## Abstract
 - TCR is heterodimer, mediates pathogen-associated epitope recognition through interactions between peptide and MHC, generated by genomic rearrangement of germline TCR locus (VDJ recombination) to allow potentially 10^15 to 10^61 unique receptors
 - TCRs from T cells that recognize the same pMHC epitope often share conserved sequence features, perhaps able to predict model epitope specificity
 - here, they study CD8<sup>+</sup> TCRs in mice and humans to study these conserved features as well as features differentiating them
 - **takehome: each epitope-specific repertoire studied had a clustered group of receptors with core sequence similarities plus a dispersed set of diverse "outlier" sequences, so some similar but some different sort of unhelpful**
# Regulatory T cells suppress CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cell activation by controlling protein synthesis
## Abstract
 - Tregs suppress CD4 effector T cells
 - Tregs suppress activation-induced global protein synthesis in CD4 effector T cells before cell division
 - mRNAs encoding for protein synthesis machinery regulated at translational level in activated CD4 effector T cells by Tregs
 - Tregs suppress global protein synthesis of CD4 effector T cells by inhibiting mRNAs of translation machinery at level of mTORC1-mediated translational control via immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGFβ
 - RNA helicase eIF4A inhibitor rocaglamide A can alleviate inflammatory CD4 effector T cell activation by Treg depletion *in vivo*
## Introduction
 - FOXP3 mutations can drive autoimmunity, linked to loss of functional Tregs
 - Tregs can suppress CD4 effector T cells directly or through modulation of APCs (mostly DCs)
 - proposed suppression mechanisms: suppressive cytokine release (TGFβ, IL-10, IL-35), inhibitory receptor expression (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT)
 - upon activation, resting T cells undergo rapid reprogramming in preparation of cell division, includes increased translation
# Repertoire analyses reveal T cell receptor sequence features that influence T cell fate
## Abstract
 - **TRB CDR3 hydrophobicity promotes reactivity to self-peptides**
## Introduction
 - TCR-pMHC signal strength drives fate decisions, i.e. too strong favors T<sub>reg</sub>, so TCR sequence features conceivably can influence fate decision
 - only analyze TRB CDR3s here
## Results
### T<sub>regs</sub> use specific amino acids in the CDR3β middle region
 - **middle region of T<sub>regs</sub> has more F, L, W, Y (hydrophobic residues) than effector T cells (which has more negatively charged residues than T<sub>regs</sub>)**
### CDR3β V and J regions explain variance in T cell state
 - previous literature: MHC genetic variation shapes frequency of *TR(A/B)V* gene usage in repertoire, ***TRAV* contacts MHC at more polymorphic sites, *TRBV* contacts MHC at more conserved sites**
 - *TRBV* gene usage explains significant amount of variance in T cell fate
### T<sub>regs</sub> are enriched for CDR1β charge and CDR3β hydrophobicity
 - specifically at positions p109/p110
### TiRP explains T<sub>reg</sub> plasticity in the tumor microenvironment
 - previous literature: naive T thymic emigrants can be peripherally induced to adopt regulatory phenotype, and T<sub>regs</sub> can lose *FOXP3* expression and adopt pro-inflammatory phenotype (exT<sub>regs</sub>), expanded clones observed as both T<sub>regs</sub> and conventional T cells may represent such lineages (mixed clones)
 - hypothesis: TCR features of these mixed clones may be intermediate, increasing conversion susceptibility
# Retrospective study of advanced melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab after nivolumab: analysis of 60 Japanese patients
# Risk factors and biomarkers for immune-related adverse events: a practical guide to identifying high-risk patients and re-challenging immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - higher risk of irAE associated with age < 60 years, high BMI, women on CTLA-4, men on PD-1 blockade, chronic smoking, pre-existing autoimmune disease, anti-inflammatory drug use, 
 - organ-specific irAEs associated with pre-existing organ dysfunction
 - high pre-treatment soluble CTLA4 associated with irAEs
# Role of B cells as antigen presenting cells
 - B2s: conventional B cells
 - Bregs: suppress inflammation, < 1% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
 - activation of B cells as APCs occurs via BCR (T-cell dependent) or via germline encoded PAMP receptors (T cell independent)
# Role of recombination activating genes in the generation of antigen receptor diversity and beyond
## Abstract
 - V(D)J recombination: antigen receptor gene segments cleaved, rejoined by NHEJ
 - RAG1/2 (recombination activating genes) drive cleavage, sequence specific nucleases
## The discovery of *RAG* genes
 - RAG1/2 unique to vertebrates
## Antigen receptors of lymphoid system
 - antibodies/immunoglobulins are glycoproteins composed of 4 polypeptides (2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light chains held together by disulfide bonds)
 - N-terminal sequences of antibodies (variable region, 110-130 residues) vary greatly and gives antigen specificity, C-terminal seqences more constant (constant region)
 - exon encoding variable region (N-terminus of antibodies) assembled from 2 or 3 gene segments: V (variable), D (diversity, only for immunoglobulin heavy chains, TCR-β, and TCR-δ), J (joining)
 - recombination between D and J occurs to yield DJ segment, and recombination between V and DJ occurs to yield VDJ segment
 - TCR structure similar to antigen-binding fragment (F(ab)) of antibody, also has 2 glycoprotein subunits each encoded by rearranged gene, also has interchain disulfide bonds
 - TCRs are αβ or γδ pairs
 - heavy chain recombination occurs before light chain recombination (strict order, same as D-J before V-DJ and TCR-β before TCR-α), cell cycle restricted expression of enzymes helps enforce order
 - rearrangements restricted to early developmental stage
 - allelic exclusion: process by which specificity is acquired for mature lymphocytes to only express a single species of antibody/BCR/TCR in spite of having multiple allelic loci for different options
## Antigen receptor loci
 - immunoglobulin heavy chain IgH and light chain kappa (IgK) and lambda (IgL)
## Mechanism of V(D)J recombination
### Recombination signal sequence and 12/23 rule
 - recombination signal sequence (RSS): fairly conserved, adjacent to each subexon, heptamer and nonamer sequence separated by spacer of 12 or 23 bp (12RSS, 23RSS)
 - generally, 12RSS recombines only with 23RSS (and vice versa), '12/23' rule (prevents non-productive rearrangements)
### The perfect cleavage
 - RAG1/2 initiate recombination by introducing ssDNA nick at border of RSS and coding segment
### The imperfect joining
 - blund-ended signal ends can be ligated diereclty, coding ends undergo further processing (NHEJ)
## Diversity at the junction
 - when V, D, and J subexons join, several modifications like insertions and deletions can occur at junctions
## Other modes of generation of the diversity
### Class switch recombination (CSR)
 - rearrangements of constant regions upon encountering an antigen, switching of immunoglobulin isotype from IgM to IgG/E/A without changing antigen specificity
### Somatic hypermutation (SHM)
 - random genetic mutations in B cells (not T cells) at certain hotspots in antigen-binding regions following antigen encounter, increases affinity of antibodies for antigen (cells secreting antibodies that increase affinity expand)
 - within V region of heavy and light chains
# Role of the multiple T cell receptor (TCR)-ζ chain signaling motifs in selection of the T cell repertoire
 - TCR is composed of four distinct signal transducing subunits (CD3-γ, -δ, -ε, and ζ) that contain either one (CD3-γ, -δ, -ε) or three (-ζ) signaling motifs (ITAMs) within their intracytoplasmic domains
# Sequence count data are poorly fit by the negative binomial distribution
# Simultaneous epitope and transcriptome measurement in single cells
 - cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies are used to integrate cellular protein and transcriptome measurements into a single cell readout
 - DNA oligonucleotide conjugated to antibody can be measured by sequencing as digital readout of protein abundance
 - conjugate antibodies to oligonucleotides designed to be captured by oligo dT-based RNAseq library preparation, contain barcode sequence to identify the antibody, and allow PCR amplification
 - adopt streptavidin-biotin interaction to link 5' of oligos to antibodies, include disulfide link to allow oligo to be released from antibody in reducing conditions
 - incubate antibody-oligo complexes with single cell suspensions, then wash cells to remove unbound antibodies and perform scRNA-seq (of both cellular mRNAs and antibody-derived oligos that both anneal to polyT-containing microparticles via 3' polyA tails)
 - unique barcode sequence on oligos attached to microparticles indexes cDNA of mRNAs and antibody-oligos of each cell in RT reaction
 - amplified antibody-derived tags and cDNA molecules separated by size
# Single cell analyses identify circulating anti-tumor CD8 T cells and markers for their enrichment
## Abstract
 - shared CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones between blood and tumor in melanoma patients, blood clones less dysfunctional than matched T cells in tumor and more activated than non-matching T cells in blood
 - PD-1 poor sensitivity for identifying matched tumor cells in blood, perhaps because PD-1 also an activation marker and activated T cells in blood may not be tumor-specific
## Results
### Activated TM CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can be detected in the blood of melanoma patients
 - 4 patients, no ICB
### TM CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can be tracked longitudinally in patient blood and show a temporal increase in exhaustion despite anti-PD-1 treatment
 - 2 followup samples
 - higher exhaustion signature than initial sample, but still lower exhaustion than tumor
## Discussion
 - majority of tumor matched cells in blood in melanoma patients show effector or effector memory-like phenotype, contrary to exhausted-like profile prediction
# Single cell dynamics of tumor specificity vs bystander activity in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells define the diverse immune landscapes in colorectal cancer
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation via ICB successful in microsatellite instable (MSI, high TMB, more TILs) colorectal cancer, limited success against microsatellite stable (MSS, lower TMB, fewer TILs) colorectal cancer
 - MSI CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show tumor-specific activation, MSS CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show tumor unspecific or bystander features
 - **prior literature: T cells that crossreact have higher *EOMES* and *KLRG1* expression**
# Single cell RNA-seq reveals expanded clones of islet antigen-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood of subjects with type 1 diabetes
 - unclear significance of islet antigen reactive T cells in peripheral blood of T1D patients (similar cells in healthy control subjects)
 - hypothesis: key disease associated cells show evidence of prior antigen exposure, inferred from expanded TCR clonotypes and essential phenotypic properties in their transcriptomes
 - testing hypothesis: scRNAseq to identify TCR clonotypes and transcript phenotypes, apply analysis to islet antigen reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells from T1D and healthy control subjects following activation with pooled islet peptides
 - TCR results: extensive TCR clonotype sharing in antigen activated cells especially from T1D subjects, consistent with *in vivo* T cell expansion during disease progression, stable clonotypes (detect at repeat visits), see no clonotype sharing between subjects ("private" TCR specificities), IGRP seems to be a trigger for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion (recognized by expanded clones from two T1D subjects)
 - transcript results: overall transcript profiles from healthy controls and T1D subjects similar, most expanded clone profiles distinctive though
# Single cell RNA sequencing reveals distinct T cell populations in immune-related adverse events of checkpoint inhibitors
## Abstract
 - different subsets of T cells are associated with irAEs, can use these cells before ICI treatment as biomarkers to predict irAEs
 - for example, patients with immune-related arthritis have lower levels of CD8 T<sub>CM</sub> (central memory) cells at baseline, patients with immune-related pneumonitis have more CD4 T<sub>H2</sub> (subset of T helper cells that mediate activation/maintenance of antibody-mediated immune response against parasites, bacteria, allergens, toxins) cells at baseline, and patients with immune-related thyroiditis have more  CD4 T<sub>H17</sub> (secrete IL-17A cytokine, involved in defense at mucosal/epithelial barriers) cells at baseline
 - about half of patients develop irAEs from PD-1 blockade
 - methods: they use the K-nearest neighbor-based network graph-drawing layout to investigate subpopulations of T cells
## Introduction
 - prior history of autoimmune disease is one predictor of irAEs
 - perplexingly, irAEs are often organ specific (i.e. different patients have different affected organs)
 - methods: scRNAseq of peripheral blood T cells before/after ICI, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes sequencing (CITE-seq, simultaneously quantify cell surface protein and transcriptomic data within single cells using oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies) to stratify CD4 and CD8 T cells by naive and effector phenotypes, define molecular/cellular changes associated with T cell transition from self-tolerant to sensitized effector cells
## Results
### Dimensionality reduction approach to visualize scRNAseq data of patients with irAEs
 - able to see some dominant clusters among patients developing irAEs
 - some clusters show changes in relative percentages of cell populations before/after ICI
### Gene marker based cluster annotation identifies effector, regulatory, and memory subsets of peripheral T cells
 - 14/25 clusters express CD3E, 6 of which were dominated by CD8A and 8 by CD4
 - naive (i.e. Th0) CD8 T cells characterized by CD45RA, CCR7, SELL (CD62L0, LEF1)
 - central memory CD8 T cells contain CCR7, SELL, CD27 as well as CD44, CXCR3, FAS, CD28
 - subset of effector CD8 T cells express TBX21, cytotoxic markers like GZMB, KLRD1, PRF1, CD3E
 - effector memory CD8 T cells display EMOS, GZMK, IFNG
 - mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in all patients, **see higher expression of activation genes in patients with no irAEs vs. yes irAEs**
 - CD8 T helper cells express GATA3
 - wanted to investigate variability in T cells between patients with and without irAEs, perform gene set signature analysis: association of irAE T cells with T cell activation and cytokine secretion genes, so irAE T cells seem to be more associated with effector functions vs. regulatory functions
### Patients with immune-related arthritis have higher percentages of CD4 TH cells at baseline
 - enhanced T cell subset transition from naive (Th0) to effector in patients who develop arthritis serves as evidence of pervasive immune responsiveness
### Selected subsets of CD4 TH cells are associated with organ-specific irAEs
 - thyroiditis patients have more CD4 TH cells expressing RORC, IL-21
### Patients with inflammatory arthritis have lower levels of CD8 T<sub>CM</sub> cells at baseline
### Patients with immune-related pneumonitis have distinctive distributions of T cell populations
## Discussion
 - PD-1 PD-L1 interaction promotes TE cell exhaustion, supports conversion of TE cells into suppressive T<sub>reg</sub> cells
 - irAEs are frequent in patients treated with ICIs (~90% of patients treated with PD-1 blockade and/or CTLA-4 blockade), severe/life threatening (grades 3/4, respectively) irAEs in fewer but still many patients
 - at baseline, patients with arthritis had less cells with features of CD8 T<sub>CM</sub> cells, patients with pneumonitis had more CD4 T<sub>H2</sub> cells, patients with thyroiditis had more CD4 T<sub>H17</sub> cells, so **different populations of T cells are associated with different irAEs, and quantification/characterization of T cell populations before ICI treatment can serve as predictive biomarkers**
# Single cell sequencing links multiregional immune landscapes and tissue-resident T cells in ccRCC to tumor topology and therapy efficacy
 - clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) highly immune infiltrated
 - only n = 2 per group (untreat, resistant, responsive)
 - enriched CD8A<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident T cells in patient responder to ICB, tumor-associated macrophages in resistant patient
# Single cell T cell receptor sequencing: techniques and future challenges
 - αβ T cells are > 90% of T cell population; γδ T cells are less diverse and aren't MHC-restricted and are involved in innate-like responses instead
 - D-J joining happens first, then V-D-J joining for TCR β
 - CDR1-2 in V gene, CDR3 at junction of V, (D), and J
 - first sequencing-based techniques to look at CDR3 looked at CDR3 length distributions (electrophoresis of PCR fragments from amplifying across CDR3), Gaussian (normal) distribution with polyclonal TCRs and skewed with clonal enrichment
# Single-gene negative binomial regression models for RNA-Seq data with higher-order asymptotic inference
# SLC7A7 is a prognostic biomarker correlated with immune infiltrates in non-small cell lung cancer
 - SLC7A7 expression associated with poor overall survival in lung cancer patients, positively correlated with immune cell infiltration
# Specificity of T cell alloreactivity
 - many alloreactive T cells are much more peptide specific than previously thought, few if any recognize only the MHC molecule
 - alloreactive T cells are polyspecific, able to recognize multiple distinct peptide-MHC complexes (perhaps why there's a high frequency of allorecognition)
# Specificity, privacy, and degeneracy in the CD4 T cell receptor repertoire following immunization
 - math to back up hundreds to thousands of TCRs for any given antigen in a repertoire
 - mice
# Successful treatment of arthritis induced by checkpoint inhibitors with tocilizumab: a case series
 - irAEs are inflammatory side effects from ICIs
 - ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis has been reported
 - corticosteroids can treat mild irAEs, TNFα inhibitors reserved for severe cases (prolonged TNFα inhibitor use can negatively impact antitumor effect of ICI)
 - here, they try instead to use the anti IL6 receptor antibody (FDA approved to treat RA) for ICI-induced arthritis
# Targeted reconstruction of T cell receptor sequence from single cell RNA-seq links CDR3 length to T cell differentiation status
## Abstract
 - TRAPeS tool to extract TCRseq from short read scRNAseq libraries (previous methods needed long sequencing reads)
 - **'naive-like' memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have longer and less germline-like CDR3s than effector-memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells**
## Introduction
 - some antigen-experienced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have naive-like phenotype (can respond to antigen but show transcriptome/surface markers like antigen-naive T cell)
 - several dozen V and J loci for selection pool for V(D)J recombination
 - **public CDR3s often shorter, perhaps more efficient recombination**
## Methods
 - TRAPeS: identify putative pairs of V and J segments, collect putative CDR3-originating reads, reconstruct CDR3, separate similar TCRs and determine chain productivity
## Results
### Combined TCR-transcriptome analysis reveals longer CDR3 regions for naive-like YFV-specific cells
 - **they calculate germline score as ratio between number of nucleotides in CDR3 that originate from germline V(D)J segments to total number of nucleotides in CDR3, need stitching and IMGT/HighV-QUEST for this**
 - **naive-like cells have longer CDR3s and lower germline scores for both α and β chains than effector memory-like cells**
# Targeting of multiple tumor-associated antigens by individual T cell receptors during successful cancer immunotherapy
## Highlights
 - individual T cells can recognize multiple, different tumor-associated antigens
 - identification of new epitopes recognized by these "orphan" T cells
## Summary
 - in the context of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy
 - **shared x-x-x-A/G-I/L-G-I-x-x-x recognition motif was key for cross-reactive TCR**
## Introduction
 - "orphan" T cells refers to T cells with unknown specificities
 - example cross-reactive T cell here recognized 3 peptides: EAAGIGILTV from Melan A,  LLLGIGILVL from tetherin/CD317/BST2, and NLSALGIFST from IMP2
 - they use term "multipronged" whereas I've been reading/using cross-reactive, **these are different terms, multipronged for antigens on same cell and crossreactive for different antigens on different cells**
 - multipronged recognition resulted in superior recognition of cancer cells vs. recognition by single TAA
## Discussion
 - goal: what do cancer-specific T cells respond to following successful TIL therapy for stage IV melanoma
 - TIL infusion used to induce a complete response responded to a range of different cancer cell lines from different tissues, suggesting that the majority of the anticancer response in these TILs acted to target widely shared antigens rather than patient-specific, mutation-derived neoantigens
 - dominant T cell clonotype in Melan-A-reactive TIL persisted following remission, also responds to a wide range of cancer cell lines not expressing Melan A, suggesting response to widely expressed tumor associated antigens
 - **what they discuss as multipronged here is different from crossreactivity I'm interested in as crossreactivity is for antigens on different cancer cells and, here, multipronged is for different antigens on the same cancer cell**
# Targeting PI3Kα increases the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody in cervical cancer
 - *PIK3CA* mutation results in increase PD-L1 levels, repression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation in cervical cancer
# T cell characteristics associated with toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade in patients with melanoma
## Abstract
 - irAEs in 10-60% of patients with melanoma treated with ICI
 - **does a common baseline immunological state precede irAE?**
 - methods: mass cytometry, scRNAseq, single cell V(D)J sequencing, bulk RNAseq, bulk TCR sequencing to study peripheral blood from melanoma patients treated with PD-1 blockade (+/- CTLA-4 blockade)
 - **activated CD4 effector memory T abundance and TCR diversity associated with irAE**
## Introduction
 - SNP in microRNA-146a (regulates innate immunity, inflammation, antiviral pathway) linked with irAE
 - pre-existing autoantibodies, autoreactive tissue-resident T cells, and T cells with specificity for viral antigens (from chronic viral infections) also implicated in irAE
 - gut microbiome changes (leading to increased colonic IL-1ß) also linked with irAE
## Results
### Determinants of severe irAEs from pretreatment blood
 - CD4 effector memory T cells at higher levels in pretreatment blood associated with severe irAE
 - single cell TCR clonotype diversity of activated CD4 T 5+3 (**two clusters I think**) cells elevated in patients with severe irAEs, so TCR richness eclipses loss of diversity resulting from clonal expansion, also see a trend between bulk (not just activated CD4) TCR diversity in pretreatment samples and irAE development although the association is primarily attributable to CD4 T cells with effector memory profile (BCR diversity not associated with irAE as much)
### Extended analysis of T cell features associated with irAEs
 - verify scRNAseq findings with bulk RNAseq of additional patient blood samples (again see association between CD4 TEM cell levels and severe irAE development as well as higher TCR clonotype diversity predicting severe irAE development)
 - a composite model integrating activated CD4 TM cell abundance and bulk TCR diversity outperforms either feature alone in predicting severe irAE development regardless of ICI therapy type, ICI response status, age, sex, melanoma subtype, affected organ
 - model scores increase as a function of irAE severity, also predicts time to irAE development
### Peripheral TCR clonal expansion linked to severe irAEs
 - prior evidence of clonally expanded self/virus-reactive T cells in affected tissue linking self/pathogen-recognizing T cell clones to irAEs (**I wonder why viral antigen recognition would lead to irAEs, good for the viral-infected cells to be attacked, right? but perhaps its an inappropriately strong immune response**)
 - nonetheless, they hypothesize that pre-treatment TCR clonotypes in peripheral blood might show greater propensity to expand in patients destined to develop severe irAEs after ICI
 - observe increased TCR clonal expansion and persistence of baseline clones in patients developing severe irAEs (preferential expansion of activated CD4 TEM)
### Circulating leukocytes in autoimmune disease
 - does baseline peripheral blood profile of patients with severe irAEs resemble that of patients with autoimmune disease? compare to systemic lupus or IBD patients
 - circulating activated CD4 TM cells associated with autoimmune disorders
 - **severe irAEs may represent a subclinical or latent autoimmune state that is unmasked upon ICI treatment**, tracks with patients with autoimmune disease having flare ups after ICI treatment, **this may have implications for the investigation into the correlation between ICI clinical response and irAEs i.e. if you only observe irAEs in those predisposed to autoimmune conditions and if this doesn't relate to ICI clinical response then they won't always correlate**
## Discussion
 - identify two baseline features (activated CD4 TM cell abundance and more clonally diverse TCR repertoire in peripheral blood) as determinants of ICI-induced irAEs in melanoma patients
 - also find elevated activated CD4 TM cells in autoimmune disease patients, so perhaps a common immunological mechanism between irAEs and autoimmunity
 - previous studies had linked activated T cells and clonally expanded TCRs to severe irAEs but this study was uniquely looking at pre-treatment T cell characteristics
 - unanswered question: do circulating activated CD4 TM cells (their abundance here found to correlate with irAE development) exhibit a higher propensity to recognize self-antigens in patients at risk for severe ICI induced irAEs?
 - limitations: retrospective, different ICIs studied at same time here (each with different irAE risks), most irAEs occur within first 3 months but some can occur later (which would have been missed here, median time to severe irAE here was ~6 weeks with no irAEs after 3 months)
# T cell immune awakening in response to immunotherapy is age-dependent
 - patients > 70 have more clonal TCRs after ICB, younger show more diverse TCRs with ICB
# T cell invigoration to tumour burden ratio associated with anti-PD-1 response
## Abstract
### Background
 - monotherapies based on PD-1 (programmed cell death) blockade (i.e. to reinvigorate exhausted tumor-specific T cells) have been successful in durably treating some but not most melanoma patients
 - pre-existing T cell infiltration into tumor, presence of PD-L1 in tumors can be used as indicators of clinical responses (**guessing positive and negative prognosis respectively without PD-1 blockade treatment and both positive for PD-1 blockade**), although these indicators are not optimal, **need for better predictors of PD-1 blockade treatment effectiveness**
### Gap in field
 - immune blood profiling based understanding of PD-1 blockade mechanisms
### Methods
 - immune peripheral blood profiling of stage IV melanoma patients before/after PD-1 blockade (targeting antibody, pembrolizumab)
### Results
 - changes in circulating exhausted CD8 T cells
 - most patients show immune response to PD-1 blockade (pembrolizumab)
 - clinical failure mostly from imbalance between T cell reinvigoration and tumor burden
 - clinical response correlates with magnitude of T cell reinvigoration (relative to predrug burden)
 - **profile mechanistically relevant subpopulation of circulating T cells calibrated to predrug disease burden, able to identify clinically accessible predictor of PD-1 blockade treatment outcome**
 - **I'm curious how the calibration works above**
## Introduction
 - PD-L1 (ligand or PD-1 inhibitory receptor) expression in tumors suppress T cell response --> dysfunctional/exhausted T cells
 - exhausted T cells are less effective and exhibit distinct transcriptional profile compared to effector and memory CD8 T cells (**what I assume from it being said they have distinct differentiation patterns**)
 - **major challenge is knowing who will benefit from PD-1 blockade and who won't before giving the antibody treatment**
 - **goal: use peripheral blood profiling to detect responses to checkpoint (PD-1) blockade, identify relevant cell types... to better predict who will and who won't benefit from PD-1 blockade**
## Results
### Healthy donor vs. melanoma patients
 - all patients previously had anti-CTLA-4 therapy (a different checkpoint blockade treatment analogous to PD-1 blockade)
 - most patients didn't do well with PD-1 blockade (as measured by RECIST criteria guidelines)
 - comparative methods: flow cytometry (see frequencies of CD4, CD8 T cells, memory T cell subsets, co-expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors like PD-1, CTLA-4, 2B4, TIM-3 with CD4 or CD8), **perhaps high co-expression of PD-1 for example with CD4 and CD8 in T cells indicates likely exhaustion and therefore a good response to PD-1 blockade with reinvigoration of T cells, but later they see that anti PD-1 immune response isn't good predictor of clinical response**
 - evidence for prior immune response in melanoma patients (vs. healthy controls): higher CD4<sup>+</sup> FOXP3<sup>+</sup>  (**T<sub>reg</sub> marker**) T cell frequency, higher Ki67 expression by FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells, Ki67 higher in CD8 T cells in melanoma patients especially in PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cell subset, **higher proliferation (Ki67 is proliferation marker, also marks T cell reinvigoration, seems reasonable that exhausted T cells proliferate slower) and frequency of certain T cells (FOX3P is T<sub>reg</sub> marker, and T<sub>regs</sub> suppress immune responses**)
 - can also track proliferation with CFSE (fluorescence halves as cells divide, non-fluorescent until it enters cells and is hydrolyzed by enzymes and retained by cells)
### Pharmacodynamic immune response to anti PD-1
 - frequency of Ki67<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells goes up then down with PD-1 blockade treatment (figure 1B: count of cells with Ki67<sup>+</sup> over some threshold)
 - cytotoxic, proliferating Ki67<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cell population CD45RA<sup>low</sup> (**not sure of significance**), CD27<sup>high</sup> (**CD27<sup>low</sup> is effector T cell**), CTLA-4<sup>high</sup> and PD-1<sup>high</sup> (immune checkpoints), 2B4<sup>high</sup> (**not sure of significance**), Eomes<sup>high</sup> and T-bet<sup>low</sup> which **seems to** indicate a exhausted T cell phenotype
 - healthy patient Ki67<sup>+</sup> (proliferating) population largely Eomes<sup>high</sup> T-bet<sup>high</sup> (effector T cell phenotype), **so melanoma patients have more exhausted T cells than healthy patients, makes sense with consistent immune response to melanoma that expresses inhibitory receptors**
 - increased proliferation from treatment most evident in PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells (**evidence of immune response to PD-1 blockade**)
 - 74% of patients had PD-1 immune response, but only 38% had clinical response, **so anti PD-1 immune response is not a good predictor of clinical response**
### Reinvigorated T<sub>exhausted</sub> cells detected in peripheral blood
 - do CD8 PD-1<sup>+</sup> CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> T cells provide greater precision in tracking effects of PD-1 blockade? they seem to be mostly Eomes<sup>high</sup> T-bet<sup>low</sup> and CD45RAL<sup>low</sup> CD27<sup>high</sup>, **exhausted phenotype?**
 - also see increased Ki67 expression in these cells from treatment (50% Ki67<sup>+</sup> before treatment --> 75% Ki67<sup>+</sup> after treatment), much lower Ki67 expression in PD-1<sup>+</sup> CTLA-4<sup>-</sup> T cells (**so T cells expressing both inhibitory receptors are more reinvigorated from exhaustion?**)
 - **takeaway seems to be the more inhibitory receptors a T cell expresses, the more the cell responds to anti-PD-1 therapy, i.e. reinvigorate from exhausted state**
 - methods: mass cytometry (like flow cytometry but use heavy metal ion labeled antibodies instead of fluorochromes to get many more parameters and high dimensionally analyze single cells) and RNAseq
 - see PD-1 expressed by exhausted T cells, but also by memory (CCR7<sup>high</sup>) and effector (CD27<sup>low</sup>) T cells
 - see population of cells expressing exhaustion markers (Eomes, CD39) that increased in frequency and Ki67 expression after PD-1 blockade (reinvigoration), express granzymes (cytotoxic T cell method of killing target cells by inducing apoptosis)
### Responding T cell clones from blood found in tumor
 - the reinvigorated T<sub>ex</sub> cells in blood are also found in tumor
### T cell reinvigoration correlates with tumor burden
 - antigen burden key determinant of exhaustion severity and reinvigoration by PD-1 blockade, want to test if that is true here in melanoma
 - evidence of pre-existing CD8 T cell response related to tumor burden, augmented by PD-1 blockade
### Reinvigoration/tumor ratio affects clinical outcome
 - perhaps larger baseline immune responses correlate with clinical response
 - however, higher pre-treatment Ki67 (proliferation) levels in PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells was associated with poor prognosis
 - rather, perhaps a larger baseline immune response may reflect a higher tumor burden that is itself indicates poor prognosis
 - Ki67 levels don't correlate with clinical outcome alone, so rather than reinvigoration magnitude, perhaps its the exhausted T cell:tumor burden ratio that better predicts clinical response
## Discussion
 - most patients have an on-target immunological, detectable effect of PD-1 blockade on CD8 T cells
 - see exhausted T cells as major target of PD-1 blockade (reinvigoration)
 - most patients have a single peak of PD-1 blockade-induced immune reinvigoration despite on-going treatment
 - responding exhausted T cells in blood contain TCR clonotypes shared with tumor infiltrating T cells
 - ratio of exhausted T cell reinvigoration to tumor burden predicts clinical response
# T cell mediated autoimmune disease due to low-affinity crossreactivity to common microbial peptides
## Summary
 - microbial peptide common to several major bacterial classes can induce MS-like disease in humanized mice by crossreacting with TCR that also recognizes peptide from myelin basic protein (candidate MS autoantigen)
 - crossreactivity due to structural mimicry of binding hotspot shared by self and microbial antigens rather than degenerate TCR recognition
 - autoreactive TCR binding affinity much lower than affinity for microbial (mimic) peptide
## Introduction
 - MS associated with 3 different MHCII alleles of HLA-DR2 haplotype in northern Europeans: DRB1*1501, DRB5*0101 (encode β chains of DR2b and DR2a molecules, respectively), DQB1*0602 (encodes β chain of HLA-DQ6.2)
 - HLA-DR, not HLA-DQ, implicated in MS susceptibility, HLA-DR restricted T cell mediated autoimmunity to myelin antigens
 - **mechanism: self-reactive TCRs require affinity low enough to escape negative selection in thymus but high enough for activation in periphery**
 - molecular mimicry hypothesis: some T cells respond to epitope derived from infectious agent can crossreact with self antigen that shares sequence/structural homology with microbial peptide
## Discussion
 - **does molecular mimicry result from inherent degeneracy in TCR binding mode (promiscuity) or a structural equivalence between pMHC surfaces presented for TCR recognition? kind of both but seems to lean towards structural equivalence with hotspot mimicry (small number of key residues in TCR binding site rather than high-affinity structural affinity inwhich all binding features would need to be replicated)**, perhaps helps explain why it has been difficult to incriminate specific individual infections in autoimmune disease development (degeneracy in crossreactivity?)
# T cell receptor beta variable gene polymorphism predicts immune-related adverse events during checkpoint blockade immunotherapy
 - TCRB and TRBV gene polymorphisms implicated in autoimmunity, perhaps irAEs too
 - find TRBV allele haplotype protective against severe irAEs
# T cell repertoire analysis and metrics of diversity and clonality
 - **TCRαβ heterodimer disulfide linked, each chain has constant and variable domain, 3 CDRs per chain so CDR1-3 α and β**
 - **CDR3 product of junctional diversity, most variable**
 - **TCR-pMHC binding rather low-affinity, degenerate (many TCRs recognize same peptide and many peptides recognized by same TCR)**
 - **CDR1-2 contact MHC and CDR3 contacts peptide is the general rule, but CDR1α also contacts peptide and CDR3β doesn't contact peptide too much**
## Diversity meaures
 - richness refers to number of unique TCR sequences, evenness refers to distribution spectrum of these TCR sequences (relative abundances)
 - diversity relates to level of uncertainty that TCR sequence sorted from reportoire would belong to a certain T cell clone (unique TCR sequence)
 - Shannon entropy: order (α) of 1, 0 means monoclonal, max (log of number of unique sequences) means evenely distributed TCR sequences, encounters higher variation upon addition of low frequency clones than Gini-Simpson index
 - Gini-Simpson index: order (α) of 2, 0 means monoclonal, 1 means polyclonal with equivalent representation of all clones, barely affected by increasing number of unique TCRs in repertoire (unlike Shannon entropy)
 - Pielou's index (evenness measure): clonal evenness refers to clonal diversity, 1 - Pielou's index is often used and here 0 means maximally diverse and 1 means monoclonal
 - Gini coefficient: inequality measure, distinct from Gini-Simpson index, 0 means maximal diversity, high value means monoclonal
# T cell repertoire diversity: friend or foe for protective antitumor response?
 - **CD3 is signal transducing subunit for TCR**
 - immune changes in aging: fewer naive T cells able to respond to new antigens, higher representation of more differentiated effector/memory T cells
 - **high TCR diversity/richness/evenness (all same here, highly polyclonal synonyms) in blood associted with good ICB outcome**
# T cell tolerance: central and peripheral
## Summary
 - central tolerance: clonal deletion and diversion (Treg differentiation) control self-reactive T cells in the thymus
 - peripheral tolerance: anergy (T cells becoming functionally unresponsive) and deletion of self-reactive T cells occurs outside thymus in cases where central tolerance fails to control self-reactivity and self-reactive T cells encounter self-antigens (not all antigens T cells need to be tolerant of are expressed in thymus)
## T cell differentiation
 - T lymphocytes arise from circulating bone-marrow-derived progenitors going to thymus
 - T cell lineage commitment and expansion
 - TCR gene rearrangement gives rise to γδ or αβ progenitors at CD4 and CD8 double-negative stage
 - fraction of αβ committed double-negative cells give rise to many CD4 and CD8 double-positive thymocytes
 - somatic recombination of TCR genes results in broad repertoire of αβ TCRs with random specificities
 - double-positive thymocytes expressing TCRs that have no/low affinity for self-peptide-MHC complexes die by neglect
 - double-positive thymocytes expressing TCRs that have intermediate affinity for self-peptide-MHC differentiate to CD4 or CD8 single-positive thymocytes (positive selection) in the cortex, single-positive thymocytes go to the medulla
 - double-positive thymocytes expressing TCRs that have high affinity for self-peptide-MHC pose a threat to self-tolerance, so they undergo clonal deletion, diversion to Treg lineage, anergy, or receptor editing (secondary gene rearrangements of TCRα loci)
# T cell tolerant fraction as a predictor of immune-related adverse events
 - tolerant fraction characterized according to productive/non-productive TCRB sequences, **not sure how this relates, I understand their hypothesis that more tolerant T cells would lead to lower irAE risk but I don't understand how tolerant fraction can be estimated from productive fraction, productive just means it can function and bind some antigen not necessarily self/foreign?**
 - **so they say "In healthy subjects, we considered TRB sequences that are expressed to be tolerant; otherwise, the subject would not be healthy" which does make sense but what about abundance? healthy people have rare self-reactive T cells that's known I think**
# TCR sequencing and cloning methods for repertoire analysis and isolation of tumor-reactive TCRs
## Abstract
 - SEQTR (SEQuencing T cell Receptor): combines *in vitro* transcription and single primer pair TCR amplification, combine with PCR to amplify TCR from bulk population, tumor-specific TCR identification and cloning
 - TCR RNA expression doesn’t affect clonotype quantification, **meaning that you can't infer clonotype frequencies from RNA levels?**
## Introduction
 - TCR repertoire refers to assembly of TCR sequences
## Other TCRseq methods
### Multiplex PCR
 - uses pool of primers that targets all V and J germline genes to amplify entire V(D)J rearrangements, or specifically CDR3 region
 - can introduce amplification biases due to differential primer efficiency
### 5' RACE
 - rapid amplification of cDNA ends
 - uses a single primer that targets known C-gene region of mRNA transcripts
 - associated with poor efficiency of template switch that adds 5' adapter in only 20-60% of RNA molecules
## RNA-based assays allow clonotype quantification
### DNA-based assays
 - DNA is more stable and present at fixed copy numbers (easier quantification)
 - DNA from irrelevant V and J segments not part of rearranged TCR sequence is still present, introducing noise
 - DNA includes both TCRβ alleles while only one is usually present (allelic exclusion)
### RNA-based assays
 - RNA reflects what T cell expresses
 - large RNA copy number increases sensitivity
 - RNA is compatible with UMIs to correct amplification and sequencing errors
 - RNA is thought to bias clonotype quantification because of variations in TCR expression among cells, so they perform scTCR-seq to look at TCR mRNA and clonotype (TCR expressing same TCR at protein level) frequencies in same assay
### scTCR-seq
 - tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in melanoma patients
 - T cells express 10 TCRα and 21 TCRβ (presumably unique) mRNA molecules on average (**just 1 per cell though right, so in each patient on average see 10 and 21 unique TCRα and TCRβ mRNA molecules, respectively, on average?**)
 - TCR expression varied 2-fold around median in 70% of cells
 - intra-clonotype TCR expression heterogeneity similar to inter-cell heterogeneity, so TCR expression is not clonotype dependent
 - different T cell states express TCRs to similar degrees (activated cells' TCR expression slightly lower)
# TCR-sequencing in cancer and autoimmunity: barcodes and beyond
## Summary
 - since T cells have unique TCRs (stably maintained through cell divisions), TCR barcodes T cell through migration, differentiation, proliferation
 - limitations: unable to infer antigen specificity from TCR sequence
## Glossary
 - **clonal replacement: recruitment of less dysfunctional peripheral T cell clonotypes to tumor that were not detectable in tumor prior to PD-1 blockade, i.e. from tumor draining lymph node, more important in ICI than previously thought**
 - **clonal revival: replenishment of highly dysfunctional T cell clones in tumor with new, less dysfunctional T cells (perhaps from periphery, local expansion within tumor) that can be novel clonotypes (i.e. clonal replacement) or clonotypes pre-existing in tumor**
 - **clone (set of T cells that are clonal progeny due to shared clonotype and host) vs. clonotype (paired α and β TCR nucleotide sequence of a T cell)**
 - **MHC haplotype: combination of MHC alleles found in a single individual**
 - neoadjuvant: treatment (surgery, radiation) given before definitive, curative treatment
 - neoantigens: antigens from somatic mutations in tumors
 - **private (unique to a single individual) vs. public (found in multiple individuals) TCR sequences**
 - TCR fingerprint: family of peptides recognized by single TCR
## Single cell TCR seq: bringing high-throughput single cell precision to T cell immunology
 - naive T cells trafic through spleen, lymph nodes, blood in search of APCs to initiate T cell activation
 - T cell activation requires antigen-specific signal via TCR interacting with peptide bound to MHC (pMHC) on APC and co-stimulatory signal delivered by CD28 co-stimulatory receptor on T cell binding to B7 ligands on APC
 - inflammatory signals promote full T cell effector differentition, leading to extensive prolifertion, transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming, and production of effector molecules (i.e. secretion of inflammatory cytokines, cytotoxicity)
 - **affinity of TCR for pMHC can affect propensity to become effector or memory T cell**
 - **naive T cells are very plastic, one clone can lead to diverse cell states**
 - can use *in vivo* deuterium labeling to mark proliferating cells, for example to show that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory cells derive from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that extensively divided during first 2 weeks of infection and have a doubling time of > 450 days
 - **challenges of scTCRseq and scRNAseq: ambiguous antigen specificities, polyspecific nature of TCR binding to pMHC, presence of both antigen-specific T cells and bystander T cells in tissues of interest, statistical inference issues related to sample size**
 - polyspecific nature of TCR-pMHC binding: TCRs able to recognize multiple pMHCs, very difficult to predict binding
 - **just because a T cell is antigen specific doesn't mean it is functional (secreting effector cytokines, killing cells), just because a T cell is a bystander (non-antigen specific, i.e. in tumors T cells not binding tumor-associated antigens, perhaps a virus-specific T cell in a cancer associated with viral infection like HPV or hepatitis B, bystander infiltration here good for prognosis) doesn't mean it doesn't contribute to an immune response**
## Methods for tracking T cells of interest
 - virtually all naive T cells have different TCR sequences
 - combinations of V, D, J segments in humans allows 10<sup>14</sup> to 10<sup>19</sup> possible TCR sequences, though the observed number is around 10<sup>8</sup> likely due to T cell developmental constraints (failure to undergo positive selection, negative selection)
 - **T cell activation can induce ~15-20 divisions, expanding number of antigen-specific T cells ~50,000 fold (likely upper limit of clonal expansion)**, clonal expansion in autoimmunity and cancer likely lower due to suboptimal T cell activtion (low-affinity antigens, low inflammation)
 - T cells of a single clonotype are rare in peripheral blood
### Antigen-directed methods for detecting T cells of interest
 - antigen-directed methods: identification based on T cell's ability to bind/recognize specific antigens (like tetramer assay in which soluble pMHC molecules are complexed to streptavidin core labeled with fluorescent marker or DNA barcode)
 - **limitations of tetramer assay: antigen must be known, limited to number of known antigens trackable at one time (low throughput), tetramers often inefficient at detecting TCRs with low affinity for pMHC (perhaps significant for cancer, autoimmunity), tetramers can only be used in individuals with MHC haplotypes for which there are tetramers available**
 - can also use antigen stimulation *in vitro* and then sort activated T cells (by activation marker or expansion level), but can't really phenotype these cells before stimulation
 - Tconv refers to conventional, non-Treg T cell
### TCR-directed methods for detecting T cells of interest
 - **TCR sequence generated through V(D)J recombination during T cell development in thymus, random recombination of *V*, *D*, *J* segments for β chain and α chain (just *V* and *J* for α though) of each TCR**
 - bulk TCR seq often collects 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> TCRs per sample, scTCRseq often lower (100-1000 TCRs/sample), skewed distribution of clones (long tail of unexpanded clones that represent minimal fraction of true repertoire)
### Using the TCR as a barcode in cancer
 - limitation: some baseline level of clonal expansion may be needed for TCR sequence to be useful due to detection limits for identifying rare/unexpanded populations by scTCRseq
 - barcode method may have more utility in immunologically 'hot' tumors (high mutational burden, high CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration, high inflammation)
### Using the TCR as a barcode in autoimmunity
 - antigen persists for some autoimmune diseases (RA, MS) but decreases over time for others (T1D insulin-producing β cells, so pathogenic T cell population likely contracts with loss of APCs)
## Using TCR analyses to inform on mechanisms of antitumor immunity following PD-1 immunotherapy
 - pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, glioblastoma don't respond well to PD-1 blockade
### Anatomical site of action of PD-1 inhibitors: tumor vs lymph node
 - are antitumor immune responses of PD-1 inhibition driven by reinvigorated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell within tumor bed or by newly recruited tumor specific T cells (i.e. from tumor draining lymph node)? **perhaps more the latter than previously thought**
 - can use S1P agonist FTY720 to block T cell migration to study effect of recruited T cells from tumor draining lymph nodes
## Beyond a barcode: how does the TCR sequence impact T cell fate?
 - TCR hydrophobicity, electrostatic charges allows good prediction of if T cell is TIL or from adjacent normal tissue
## Conclusions
 - advanced melanoma, non small cell lung cancer are immunologically hot
 - repertoire of antigens driving responses for cancer, autoimmunity, irAEs largely unknown, major challenge
 - many autoimmune diseases feature risk polymorphisms in *HLA* genes that constrain TCR repertoire during thymic selection
# Temporal single cell tracing reveals clonal revival and expansion of precursor exhausted T cells during anti-PD-1 therapy in lung cancer
## Abstract
 - **increased levels of precursor exhausted T cells (Texp) in responsive tumors after treatment**, low expression of coinhibitory molecules and high expression of *GZMK*
 - nonresponsive tumors failed to accumulate Texp cells
 - **Texp cells unlikely to be derived from reinvigoration of terminally exhausted cells but rather accumulate by local expansion and/or replenishment by peripheral T cells with new and pre-existing clonotypes, clonal revival**
## Main
### Characterization of T cells pre- and post-PD-1 blockade by scRNA-seq
 - 36 patients with NSCLC
 - increase in expanded Th1-like cells in responsive tumor
 - Tex importance depends on pre-treatment terminal Tex infiltration: low terminal Tex baseline infiltration responsive tumors had PD-1 blockade increasing these cells (increased infiltration or expansion of these cells, consistent with increased exhausted-like T cells with ICB), but high terminal Tex baseline infiltration responsive tumors had opposite pattern (decreased frequency with ICB)
### Local expansion of pre-existing Texp cells
 - local expansion of pre-existing Texp cells drives Texp accumulation, as does clonal revival (from periphery)
# The altertions in peripheral lymphocyte subsets predict the efficacy and prognosis of immune checkpoint inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma
 - CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell percentage increases after ICI, B cell percentage decreases
# The cancer-immunity cycle: indication, genotype, and immunotype
## cancer immunity cycle
 - release of cancer cell antigens (cancer cell death)
 - cancer antigen presentation (DCs/APCs)
 - priming/activation of T cells by APCS
 - trafficking of T cells to tumors
 - infiltration of T cells into tumors (past stromal barrier)
 - recognition of cancer cells by T cells
 - killing of cancer cells
 - release of more cancer cell antigens (restart cycle)
## immunotypes
 - immunotypes: immunological phenotypes of cancers
 - inflammed (abundant immune infiltrates, untreated melanoma generally)
 - excluded (infiltrates limited to stroma as opposed to parenchyma, untreated colon cancer generally)
 - desert (no infiltrates, untreated prostate cancer generally)
## T cell exhaustion
 - exhausted T cells accumulate when amount of antigen exceeds ability for clearance by antigen-specific T cells
 - characterized by increased expression of coinhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT), these receptors also mark T cell activation
 - blocking coinhibitory receptors (i.e. ICB) can reinvigorate exhausted T cells but exhaustion is a difficult to reverse, altered epigenetic state
# The changing landscape of naive T cell receptor repertoire with human aging
 - aging associated with loss of thymus productivity, yet naive T cells still maintain abundance by division in periphery for many years
 - **shorter CDR3 β, less added N nucleotides within CDR3 β with aging**
 - **increase in publicness of CD4 but not CD8 naive T cell repertoires with aging**
 - **increased clonality with aging, as expected with clonal expansion over time**
# The diverse functions of the PD1 inhibitory pathway
## Key points
 - PD1: inhibitory receptor expressed by all T cells during activation (also B cells, NKs, some myeloid cells), regulates effector functions, often high and sustained expression in persistent antigen exposure (chronic infections, cancer) and can limit protective immunity in these cases, limits autoreactive T cells
 - PDL1: expressed broadly, can shield organs from autoimmune attack
## Abstract
 - early in the activation process, coinhibitory 'checkpoints' (like PD1) are induced to regulate T cells (counteract activation program)
## Main
 - costimulatory signals: CD28 on T cells and CD80 (B7.1) and/or CD86 (B7.2) on APCs (for example, there are other costimulatory signals)
 - CTLA-4 is one of the first negative regulators induced during T cell activation (competes with CD28 for ligands CD80/86)
 - PD1 (PDCD1, CD279) expressed during T cell activation (so PD1 marks effector T cells too not just exhausted T cells), engages ligands PDL1 (CD274, B7-H1) and/or PDL2 (CD273, B7-DC) expressed by same cell engaging T cell with pMHCI
 - effector T cells must mass these inhibitory checkpoints in order to exert full effector function
 - PD1 can also trigger phosphatases (SHP2) to counteract positive signaling between TCR-pMHCI and CD28/CD80/86
 - downstream of TCR-pMHC is transcription factor activation (like AP-1, NFAT, NK-kappa B)
 - PD1 can increase expression of transcription factors like BATF to counteract T cell activation transcriptional program
 - PDL1 can also bind CD80
 - after T cell activation, if antigen is cleared, memory T cells form and PD1 expression levels decrease (PD1 expression remains high if antigen persists and T cell exhaustion can develop)
# The good and the bad of T cell crossreactivity: challenges and opportunities for novel therapeutics in autoimmunity and cancer
 - each T cell expresses ~10,000 copies of TCR on cell surface
 - **peptide binding to MHC allelic products subject to specific rules, i.e. anchor/preferred residues in peptide for specific MHC alleles just like anchor/prefered peptide residues for specific TCRs**
 - **modes of crossreactivity: induced fit (change in CDR3 loop conformation), differential TCR docking (different docking orientation), structural degeneracy (weak TCR-pMHC interaction), molecular mimicry (similar structural/chemical features), antigen-dependent tuning of pMHC flexibility (ligand freedom on MHC)**
 - crossreactivity common for very similar peptides (1-2 residue changes)
 - crossreactivity likely tuned by coreceptors (inhibitory/activating) and adhesion molecules expressed by T cell at given time
 - **TCR conceivably could recognize ~ 1 million peptides, crossreactive peptides likely often better agonists than original one that activated T cell, but few (~1%) of peptides are actually presented on MHC, so probably crossreactivity estimate closer to 1 in ~10,000**
 - **molecular mimicry: weakly crossreactive T cells activated through recognition of infection pathogens and then crossreact with self antigens, memory T cells can be stimulated by lower concentrations of peptides than naive T cells, related to fact that infections often precipitate autoimmunity**
 - tumor-associated antigens (i.e. not neoantigens) are poorly immunogenic due to thymic negative selection of highly self-reactive T cells
 - antigen-reactive T cell fraction in peripheral immune naive repertoire very low, ~ 1 in 100,000 T cells
 - **interest in designing peptides that can activate T cells to be crossreactive against tumor associated antigens to improve immunogenicity (usually weak to tumor associated antigens)**
 - **some parts of body are immune privileged and lack HLA expression, like placenta and testis**
# The graft-versus-leukemia effect in AML
 - allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) commonly used in cancer care, most potent anti-leukemic therapy in AML (acute myeloid leukemia) patients
 - donor T cells (and maybe other immune cells) eliminate residual leukemia cells after radio/chemotherapy = graft-versus-leukemia response
 - donor alloimmune responses can also be directed against healthy tissue = graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)
 - graft-versus-leukemia and graft-versus-host often co-occur
# The IL-33/ST2 pathway: therapeutic target and novel biomrker
 - IL-33 is in IL-1 family of cytokines
 - ST2 (IL-33 receptor) is present in multiple isoforms including membrane-bound ST2L and soluble sST2 (may be decoy for IL-33)
 - ST2 participates in activation of antigen-primed Th2 cells
 - ST2 implicated in inflammatory conditions
# The nexus of dynamic T cell states and immune checkpoint blockade therapy in the periphery and tumor microenvironment
## Abstract
 - *de novo* priming of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells in peripheral blood occurs throughout course of ICB (rather than reinvigoration of pre-ICB-existing tumor infiltrating exhausted lymphocytes), possible that local expansion of antigen-specific T cells within tumor also important though
## Introduction
 - VISTA is an immune checkpoint regulator, **that I haven't heard of before**, expressed on tumor-infiltrating leukocytes and myeloid cells, suppresses T cells
 - agonists for co-stimulators, like ICOS, also being tested
 - higher intratumor PD-L1 levels correlates with higher ICB benefit, but patients with PD-1 negative tumors can still sometimes respond to ICBs (and conversely high PD-L1 expressing tumors can be ICB resistant), PD-L1 expression also varies spatially and temporally, so we need more response markers besides PD-L1 ezpression
 - using tumor biopsies to identify predictive response markers: hard to biopsy metastases, tumors are heterogeneous (sampling error), hard to obtain consecutive biopsies over ICB course
 - peripheral blood profiling: less invasive, easier longitudinally
## Immune checkpoint blockades
 - CTLA-4 blocks early T cell activation via interruption of costimulatory CD28, failure of CTLA-4 blockade to treat cancer may mean that **early T cell response is intact in cancer patients**
 - PD-1 (on T cells) interaction with PD-L1 (on tumor cells) inhibits T cells in tumor microenvironment
 - **tumor type matters for ICB response: melanoma/NSCLC have higher response rates, colon/endometrium cancers do not respond well to ICB (although those with high microsatellite instability and MMRd repsond well), tumor burden is a good predictor of ICB response (neoantigen generation to elicit antitumor immunity)**
 - **ovarian cancers ICB resistant, not known why (perhaps TIM-3 checkpoint), despite tumor-infiltrating leukocytes present in most ovarian cancer patients (or perhaps these are bystanders reactive to viruses rather than tumor antigens)**
## T cell receptor repertoire analysis and its application to dissect the mechanisms of ICB therapies
 - tumor infiltrating leukocytes may predict patient survival, ICBs originally thought to activate tumor infiltrating leukocytes, but **in responsive patients peripheral compartment is a major source of T cells activated by ICB and majority of pre-existing intratumoral T cells are terminally exhausted and refractory to ICB**
 - some pre-exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumor microenvironment (precursors of exhausted T cells, Tpex) may contribute to ICB repsonse
 - **ICB-induced clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells may be indicated by a decrease in TCR diversity**
 - **conversely, ICB-induced migration of T cells to the tumor may increase the diversity of TCR repertoire**
## Overview of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltrates in human tumor microenvironment
 - T cell infiltrates in tumor microenvironment can be tumor-reactive (CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) or bystander virus-reactive (CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, don't contribute to antitumor immunity or respond to ICB)
 - > 80% of tumor infiltrating leukocytes in ovarian tumors are bystanders, perhaps related to the lethality and ICB resistance of ovarian cancer
 - **CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets: naive (not yet exposed to antigenic stimulation, CCR7, LEF1, IL7R, TCF7, SELL), effector (stimulated by antigens, acquired cytotoxicity, perforin 1, granzymes, NK cell granule 7, CX3CR1, KLRG1, FCGR3A), memory (subset of Teff convert into resting memory that can generate many Teff cells upon restimulation by cognate antigens)**
 - **central memory vs. effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells: Tcm abundant in spleen, blood, lymph, highly proliferative upon reactivation, lymphatic homing markers (CD62L, CCR7, GPR183, CD27/28), Tem abundant in spleen and blood, highly cytotoxic upon reactivation, granzymes, KLRG1, CXCR4, GCGR3A, lack CD62L, there's also tissue resident memory T cells (Trm) that are CD103<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup> and excluded from circulation**
 - tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells eventually become exhausted due to chronic antigen stimulation, increased inhibitory receptors (PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG3, TIM-3), reduced effector functions (reduced IL-2, TNF, IFN-γ production)
### CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell dysfunction is a progressive state within tumor microenvironment
 - earlier stage tumors likely have T cells on path to terminal exhaustion, late stage tumors likely have terminally exhausted T cells
 - no drugs to reverse cellular state of terminally exhausted Tex cells, need to manipulate epigenetics/metabolism
### Characterization of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumor microenvironment during ICB therapies
 - PD-1 blockade may **transiently** reduce/revert dysfunction of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cells in tumor microenvironment
## Characterization of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood during ICBs
 - lymph nodes primary location for antigen presentation cells to activate antigen-specific T cells (**less exhausted than those in tumor microenvironment**) that can then migrate and infiltrate into tumor to complement effector population
 - **some circulating PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells share TCR sequences with T cells in TME, and this frequency predicts ICB response**
# The promising link among tumor mutational burden, immune-related adverse events, and immune checkpoint inhibitors efficacy in SCLC
 - letter in response to findings of irAEs correlating with ICB efficacy, perhaps related to association between irAE occurence and tumor mutational burden (also correlates with ICB efficacy)
 - **can see same clonotypes of T cells reactive against tumor and self in irAEs**
 - **higher tumor mutational burden and therefore antigenicity increase probability of crossreactivity because there are more distinct clonotypes of activated T cells and therefore more chances for a crossreactive clonotype to induce irAEs**, alternative hypothesis is that high tumor mutational burden correlates with ICI response therefore patients live longer and are more likely to eventually experience irAEs
 - another caveat: < 1% of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants in expressed genes result in detectable CD4/CD8 positive T cell reactivity in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, **would any be predicted in periphery?**, **frameshift mutations much more likely to lead to neoantigens**
# The relationship between hydrophobicity and drug-protein binding in human serum albumin: a quartz crystal microbalance study
 - positive correlation between drug hydrophobicity and binding strength to human serum albumin, **perhaps in contrast to hypothesis of increased crossreactivity from more hydrophobic TCRs, assuming increased crossreactivity means lower strength binding for each or a lower possible maximum...**
# The role of metabolic dysfunction in T cell exhaustion during chronic viral infection
 - dysfunction of T cell metabolism contributes to exhaustion
 - naive (Th0) and memory T cells rely mostly on OXPHOS and FA oxidation for energy, metabolism reprogrammed upon antigen recognition (generates energy but also fuels intermediates for nucleotide, amino acid, and FA synthesis and mitochondrial function, all important for T cell proliferation, differentiation, function), enhanced glycolysis ("Warburg effect", lactic acid fermentation rather than TCA despite normoxic conditions which is less efficient ATP production wise but faster kinetically, glycolysis also helps create intermediates for biomolecule synthesis) important reprogramming during CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and functioning
 - downregulation of glycolysis, augmented lipolysis and FA oxidation in exhausted T cells
# The role of peripheral T cell deletion in transplantation tolerance
# The role of type I conventional dendritic cells in cancer immunity
 - cDC1 = conventional type 1 DC, express BDCA3, CLEC9A/DNGR-1, XCR1
# The role of type-2 conventional dendritic cells in the regulation of tumor immunity
 - cDC1s dedicated to activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, cross-present tumor-derived antigens for priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - cDC2s heterogeneous, present exogenous antigens to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for initiation of T helper cell differentiation
# The somatically generated portion of T cell receptor CDR3α contributes to the MHC allele specificity of the T cell receptor
 - mice
 - **positive selection-induced MHC bias of TCRs affected both by germline encoded elements of TCRα and β chain, also affected by non-germline encoded portions of CDR3α**
 - **positive selection: bias of TCRs towards peptides bound to allele of MHC to which T cells were exposed to in thymus**
 - **peptides presented to T cells in thymus also controlled by MHC allele, so MHC allele specificity of positive selection might be dictated by peptide as well rather than just the MHC protein**
# The structural basis of T cell receptor (TCR) activation: an enduring enigma
 - the T-cell receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex is composed of a diverse αβ TCR heterodimer noncovalently associated with the invariant CD3 dimers CD3ϵγ, CD3ϵδ, and CD3ζζ
 - the TCR mediates the recognition of pMHC, whereas the CD3 molecules transduce activation signals to the T cell
 - early T cell activation (how TCR engagement by pMHC is communicated to CD3) process remains a mystery
 - **there can be 100,000 pMHCs on an APC**
 - **CDR1/2 are encoded within the TCR V segments, whereas CDR3 is formed by DNA recombination involving juxtaposition of Vα and Jα segments for α chain genes and Vβ, D, and Jβ segments for β chain genes**
 - early T cell activation model mechanisms: aggregation (of TCR-CD3 complexes), segregation (of inhibitory phosphatase CD45 from TCR-CD3), mechanosensing (TCR converts mechanical energy from T cell scanning of APCs into biochemical signal upon engaging pMHC), ligand-induced conformational change (allostery)
# The T cell receptor sequence influences the likelihood of T cell memory formation
## Abstract
 - **potential confounder for hydrophobicity:crossreactivity hypothesis, more hydrophobic CDR3s promotes regulatory T cell transcriptional states in CD4 and CD8 lineages**
 - **particular TCR amino acid sequences ~guarantee MAIT and NKT cell fates, other potential confounders**
## Introduction
 - **V(D)J gene usage known to influence transcriptional fate, *PLZF*<sup>high</sup> innate-like transcriptional fate ~guaranteed with *TRAV1-2* and *TRAJ33*, *TRAJ20*, or *TRAJ12***
## Discussion
 - **CDR3s more hydrophobic in KIR<sup>+</sup>*HELIOS*<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells, has been seen before, KIR<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells may be CD8 T<sub>regs</sub> and hydrophobic/aromatic junctional CDR3 residues may increase likelihood of self-reactivity and therefore Treg (CD4 *FOXP3* or CD8 KIR<sup>+</sup>*HELIOS*<sup>+</sup>) fate**
# The yin and yang of co-inhibitory receptors: towards anti-tumor immunity without autoimmunity
 - co-inhibitory receptors: PD-1 (CD279), CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, CD152, high sequence similarity to co-stimulatory CD28 that it outcompetes for ligands B7-1/2), TIGIT (T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain, in CD28 protein family), TIM-3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing protein-3), LAG-3 (lymphocyte activation gene-3)
 - central tolerance in the thymus acts as the first control during T cell development to eliminate autoreactive clones
 - nuclear factor AIRE expressed in thymus facilitates ectopic expression of tissue-restricted antigens, helps negatively select autoreactive T cells (autoimmune phenotype in AIRE-deficient mice), but some autoreactive T cells escape negative selection (lack of self-tissue antigen expression in thymus, altered expression of self-antigens, low affinity expression of self-antigens) so peripheral regulation is key as well
 - T cell activation requires stimulation of TCR by MHC-peptide complex (signal 1) as well as co-stimulatory signal by co-stimulatory receptors (signal 2) with corresponding ligands on APCs
 - CD28 on T cells is a co-stimulatory receptor, ligand is B7-1/2 (on APCs), other co-stimulatory receptors include ICOS, CD226, OX-40, 4-1BB, GITR
 - in T<sub>regs</sub>, co-inhibitory receptors promote suppressive function
 - loss of IL-2 production and reduced proliferation occurs during early T cell exhaustion, late exhaustion characterized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells losing the ability to produce IFNγ and TNFα and degranulate
 - co-inhibitory receptors expressed in exhausted T cells
 - IFNγ-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th1) and IL-17-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th17 cells, differentiated by TGFβ and IL-6, expanded/maintained by IL-1/IL-23) implicated in autoimmunity, but not all Th17 cells are pathogenic (Th17 cells differentiated by TGF-β1 and IL-6 produce IL-17/10 and don't mediate inflammation, IL-23 differentiated Th17 cells are "pathogenic" and drive inflammation in autoimmunity and are similar to exhausted T cells)
 - **TH1 and TH17 are non-mutually exclusive cell fates: INFγ and IL-17 double positive cells reveal Th17 plasticity to IFNγ<sup>+</sup> Th1-like phenotype**
 - co-inhibitory receptors on T cells dampen T cell effector function (enhancing tumor progression but also preventing autoimmunity by reducing local/systemic inflammation, maintaining tissue tolerance)
 - IL-17A blocking antibodies used to treat some autoimmune diseases, drugs targeting proinflammatory TNFα also approved to treat some autoimmune diseases, but these aren't efficacious for all patients or all autoimmune diseases (there's a need for treatments affecting common critical points across diverse autoimmune diseases, **for example promoting T cell exhaustion by regulating the expression or function of checkpoint molecules**)
 - deletion of CTLA-4 in adult T cells leads to upregulation of inhibitory molecules (IL-10, LAG-3, PD-1)
 - in addition to the full length form of CTLA-4 (flCTLA-4, the transmembrane receptor), a soluble form exists (sCTLA-4) that lacks the transmembrane domain (exon 3) and is associated with T1D; there's also a splice variant of CTLA-4 that is ligand-independent (liCTLA-4, lacks B7-1/2 binding domain) and inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, **not sure why this ligand-independent CTLA-4 inhibits T cells**
 - CTLA-4 expressed on activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, T<sub>regs</sub> as well in cancer (anti-CTLA-4 treatment restoring exhausted T cell effector functions perhaps mainly due to depletion of T<sub>regs</sub>)
 - CTLA-4 levels usually anti-correlate with clinical outcome in cancer, but in non-small cell lung cancer high CTLA-4 expression in tumors actually predicts survival, **not sure of the mechanism for this inverted trend here**
 - PD-1 has two ligands: PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274, broadly expressed across tissue) and PD-L2 (B7-DC, CD273, only expressed on dendritic cells and some myeloid i.e. blood cells), PD-L1/2 expressed on various tumor cells
 - PD-1 expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells, monocytes, some dendritic cells
 - TIM-3 expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (more so on Th1 than Th17 cells, highly expressed by CD8<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> T cells which are a dysfunctional subset of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in tumors), NK cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes, ligands are galectin-9, phosphatidylserine, CEACAM1
 - TIM-3 OE on T cells leads to expansion of suppressor cells (old name for T<sub>regs</sub> **I think**), promotes tumor growth
 - TIGIT expressed on activated T cells, some T<sub>regs</sub>, T<sub>fh</sub> cells, and NK cells, ligands are CD155 (PVR) and CD112 (PVRL2) on APCs, T cells, tumor cells, and some non-hematopoietic cells; CD226 binds to same ligands as TIGIT, but is a co-stimulatory receptor (similar to B7:CD28:CTLA4)
 - LAG-3 expressed on activated T cells and some NK cells, binds to MHC-II with higher affinity than CD4, other ligands include LSECtin and FGL1 (fibrinogen-like protein 1)
 - T cell infiltration, particularly of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, into tumors is associated with better prognosis
 - CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can engage different differentiation pathways like Th1-type pathway that may have direct anti-tumor roles via secretion of INFγ or TNFα, but most notable effect of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is to help expand and differentiate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (which can then recognize and lyse tumor cells via granzyme B/perforin, FasL, TRAIL with the help of dendritic cells)
 - exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can't lyse tumor cells, have impaired effector functions (unable to produce effector cytokines like TNFα, IFNγ, IL-2), express co-inhibitory receptors
 - **possible sources of irAEs: aggravation of silent pre-existing autoimmune condition, neo-autoimmune or inflammatory disorder due to breakdown of self-tolerance, disruption of immune homeostasis in tissue (not sure exactly what this means), bystander self-tissue damage (on target, off tumor response), undesired reactions to checkpoint blockade (expression of co-inhibitory molecules on non-T cells for instance)**
 - **similarities between pathogenic, inflammation-driving Th17 (and Th1) cells and exhausted T cells could be exploited to treat cancer without inducing irAEs: PDPN expressed on Th17 cells and negatively regulates Th17 pathogenicity, PDPN also part of co-inhibitory gene module upregulated in cancer; PROCR also expressed in Th17 cells (also negatively regulates pathogenicity via repressing IL-1R) and exhausted T cells (PROCR deficiency inhibits tumor growth)**
 - another idea to limit irAEs from ICI is to treat the autoimmune side effects, for example with TNF blockade (which can even enhance ICI efficacy in targeting tumor beyond limiting irAEs, **not sure of mechanism here**)
# Toxicity-specific peripheral blood T and B cell dynamics in anti-PD-1 and combined immune checkpoint inhibition
## Abstract
 - flow cytometry
 - irAEs after ICI characterized by enhanced proliferation of Th1-associated (mainly CD4<sup>+</sup>) CD27<sup>-</sup> effector memory T cells, also Th17-associated immune responses and germinal center activation (CXCL13 and IL-21 increases)
 - see no changes in CD21<sup>low</sup>, memory, class-switched, or newly activated B cell subsets
 - PD-1<sup>+</sup>LAG-3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show enhanced cytotoxic capacity in patients with irAEs after ICI
 - irAEs from PD-1 associated with enhanced Th1-associated responses (increased serum CXCL9/10)
 - **growing body of evidence that irAEs are driven by newly activated CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells**
## Introduction
 - irAEs should be considered separate from autoimmune disease, more acute onset and possibility of complete reversibility with adequate therapy
 - biomarkers of irAE development: higher baseline blood lymphocyte count, proliferation of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets (particularly effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells), baseline Th17 dominance, early increase in CD21<sup>low</sup> B cells
 - role for T cell autoreactivity in irAE development (CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clonal expansion preceeding irAEs and epitope sharing between tumor and irAE-affected tissue)
## Results
### CD27<sup>-</sup> CD4<sub>EM</sub> T cell proliferation is strongly associated with irAEs in combined ICI
### Th1- and Th17-associated immune responses primarily delineate irAEs after combined ICI, while anti-PD-1 TOX features only a modest Th1-associated response
## Discussion
 - helper T cells may provide help to autoantibody-producing B cells
# Treg heterogeneity, function, and homeostasis
 - Tregs ensure tolerance to autoantigens, antigens of commensal microflora, limit excess immune responses, induce tolerance to food antigens
 - IL-10 and TGF-β are primary suppressive cytokines
 - IL-2 and its receptor CD25 are important for developing and maintaing Tregs
 - FoxP3 is main Treg transcription factor, associated with high CD25 expression
 - Tregs defined as CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>
 - Tregs can develop in thymus (tTregs, express FoxP3, high autoaffinity TCR, provide tolerance to autoantigens) or peripherally (pTregs, prevent local inflammation in presence of exogenous antigens) from effector cells
# Tumor-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells enter a TCF1<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>-</sup> dysfunctional state
 - self/shared antigens (SSA): tumor antigens aberrantly expressed but not mutated i.e. shared with normal tissue
 - tumor-specific antigens: mutated proteins or oncogenic viral proteins
 - genetic cancer mouse model in which they can track tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and self/shared antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation longitudinally as liver cancers develop
 - find that both tumor and self/shared antigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells lost effector function over time but in different ways: **tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells persist long term but are dysfunctional/exhausted (PD-1<sup>+</sup>, CD39<sup>+</sup>, TOX<sup>+</sup>) while self/shared antigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exit cell cycle prematurely and disappear from liver lesions but persist in spleen in dysfunctional TCF1<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>-</sup> state unable to produce effector cytokines or proliferate in response to PD-1 blockade**
# Type 1/Type 2 immunity in infectious diseases
 - Th1 (T helper type 1) cells secrete IL-2, interferon-γ, lymphotoxin-α and stimulate type 1 immunity (intense phagocytic activity), more or less synonymous with cell-mediated immunity but some antibodies are still produced, protective for most infections
 - Th2 cells secrete IL-4/5/9/10/13 and stimulate type 2 immunity (high antibody titers), more or less synonymous with humoral immunity (Th2 cells suppress phagocytosis), resolves cell-mediated inflammation
 - systemic stress, immunosuppression cause type 2 response to infection normally controlled by type 1 response
# Uncoupling therapeutic efficacy from immune-related adverse events in immune checkpoint blockade
## Improving immunotherapeutic strategies to reduce irAEs
### Broadening checkpoint blockade antibody strategies
 - perhaps try dual immunodulatory antibodies (bispecific or antibody-based alternative structures), for example targeting PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with LAG-3/TIM-3 (perhaps promotes retention in tumor microenvironment over healthy tissue)
 - perhaps modify anti-CTLA-4 antibodies to permit expression of CTLA-4 on Tregs (CTLA-4 required for Treg inhibitory function)
# Unique features of the TCR repertoire of reactivated memory T cells in the experimental mouse tumor model
## Abstract
 - **after cognate antigen reencounter, memory T cells enriched with clonotypes that express α chain TCRs with high potential crossreactivity (more hydrophobic) and enhanced strength of interaction with pMHC**
 - no changes observed in TCR β characteristics of reactivated memory clonotypes
## Discussion
 - **CDR3 of re-stimulated TCRα memory clonotypes became rich in hydrophobic, strongly interacting, bulky residues (see same trend in middle 5 residues), perhaps associated with crossreactivity**
 - **takehome: perhaps high crossreactivity in re-stimulated memory clonotypes means higher efficiency of clones capable of recognizing multiple (tumor) peptide antigens and emergent mutants, could c ontrol tumors with high mutation rates better**
# Unraveling age-specific complexity in the human T cell compartment
 - TEA-seq to investigste transcriptomics, epitopes, and chromatin accessibility of single cells
 - compare children and older adult immune profiles
 - CD8αα T cells in children lost in older adults
# Using surface hydrophobicity together with empirical potentials to identify protein-protein binding sites. Application to the interactions of E-cadherins
 - **not sure why yet and surprising to me, but apparently hydrophobic interactions are generally the strongest for protein binding BUT don't necessarily provide specificity that comes from other residues**
 - **idea is that hydrophobic residues provide affinity and polar/charged ones provide specificity via a more limited set of specific favorable structures**
 - **takehome for me is that yes hydrophobicity should correlate with crossreactivity as more possible favorable structures are likely with higher hydrophobicity**
# V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination of immunoglobulins: mechanism and regulation
## Summary
 - V, D, J segments exist as multiple copy arrays on chromosome
 - V(D)J recombination can include deleting or inverting of intervening DNA between V, D, J segments and ligation
## Immunoglobulin structure and genetic encoding
 - immunoglobulin: 2 heavy chains (IgH) and 2 light chains (IgL, encoded by IgK and IgL genes)
 - IgH chains ahve 4 or 5 domains, IgL have 2 domains
 - IgH chains have 5 major isotypes: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, IgE, 4 subtypes of IgG and 2 subtypes of IgA
# Virus-specific memory T cell responses unmasked by immune checkpoint blockade cause hepatitis
## Abstract
 - identify subset of melanoma patients predisposed to ICB-related hepatitis distinguished by chronic expansion of effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (T<sub>EM</sub> cells)
 - pre-therapy CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cell expansion in patients with metastatic disease and high CMV-specific serum antibody titers
 - CMV reactivation as cause of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> expansion
 - pre-therapy CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> expansion predicts hepatitis in CMV-seropositive patients
## Introduction
 - **irAEs different from autoimmune diseases**
 - irAEs attributed to dysregulated T cells, autoantibodies, here they propose also pathogen-specific memory T cells
 - CMV seroprevalence is high (at least among Europeans), blood cells are major reservoir for CMV (latent)
 - CMV reactivation follows immune compromise by immunosuppressive therapy or other viral infections, reactivation can present as colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, encephalitis (**some irAEs might just be CMV reactivation from ICB??**) through viral replication and T cell immunity (overreaction of inflammation to low level viral replication)
 - cycles of CMV latency and reactivation lead to phenomenon of memory inflation: failure of primed CMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to contract and give rise to central memory T cells (instead maintain a dominant pool of effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that doesn't become exhausted)
## Results
### Clinical features do not predict αPD-1/αCTLA-4 related hepatitis
 - don't observe associations/coinciding of different irAEs (hepatitis, colitis, thyroiditis) in same patients, so **perhaps some individuals are predisposed to particular irAEs**
 - hepatitis irAE associated with younger age and less rounds of ICB (**surprising**), no association with liver function markers, tumor burden, hepatitis B/C/E virus seropositivity, or autoimmune hepatitis-related autoantibodies
### CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cell expansion predicts αPD-1/αCTLA-4 related hepatitis
 - pre-ICB: see over-representation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells associated with hepatitis, baseline expansion of these cells predicts hepatitis irAE (and not colitis, thyroiditis, or clinical response to ICB)
### Opting for αPD-1 monotherapy reduces risk of hepatitis
 - not surprising, less irAEs than combination ICB
### CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> frequency is an independent predictor of hepatitis
 - want to investigate causes of baseline CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> expansion, find liver inflammation as a common cause
### CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cell expansion is associated with chronic T cell activation
 - higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> patients had more exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD160<sup>+</sup> CD244<sup>+</sup>)
 - these higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> patients aren't generally immunocompromised despite chronically activated and exhausted T cells (no differences in Torque Teno Virus load)
### CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cell expansion correlates with immunity to CMV
 - see association between CMV-specific IgG antibody levels and T cell reactivity against CMV peptides and CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> status
### CMV-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are enriched in CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub><sup>high</sup> patients
### Valganciclovir reverses αPD-1/αCTLA-4 related hepatitis
 - anti-viral therapy with valganciclovir (anti-CMV) reverses hepatitis irAE
### Valganciclovir prophylaxis prevents αPD-1/αCTLA-4-related hepatitis
## Discussion
 - model: metastatic disease promotes compartmentalised CMV reactivation in latently infected individuals, possibly triggered by an unknown winter virus infection; in turn, CMV stimulates expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells prior to immunotherapy. When αPD-1/αCTLA-4 therapy is given, these T<sub>EM</sub> cells might inflict liver injury directly or promote bystander T cell responses
 - **anti-viral immunity might also explain predisposition to other adverse reactions following αPD-1/αCTLA-4 therapy, such as colitis or pneumonitis**
# Vitiligo-specific soluble biomarkers as early indicators of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic melanoma patients
## Abstract
 - basal CD25 serum levels were higher in stable and responding patients and remained higher during the first 3 months of CPI therapy compared to non-responders
 - CXCL9 was absent in non-responding patients before therapy
 - increase of CXCL9 levels was observed at 1 and 3 months of therapy for all patients, although higher CXCL9 amounts were present in stable and responding compared to non-responding patients
 - reduced number of regulatory T lymphocytes in responding patients
# Why must T cells be cross-reactive?
 - TCR repertoire dwarfed by potential foreign antigens
 - > 7,000 allelic variants of HLA locus in human population
 - each person expresses 6 different HLA class I molecules (2 HLA-A, 2 HLA-B, 2 HLA-C) and 6 HLA class II molecules (HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP)
 - memory T cells can recognize lower concentrations of antigen than naive T cells (> 50 fold lower), perhaps via changes in TCR expression levels, TCR clustering on cell surface, changes in expression of costimulatory molecules, control of T cell signaling, or alterations in TCR glycosylation
 - heterologous immunity: individual T cell clone can target > 1 infection through different peptides, common between related pathogens (i.e. immunity to cowpox protects against smallpox), different peptides can be dissimilar in sequence
 - connection to autoimmunity: weakly autoreactive T cells can escape negative selection in thymus and be activated through crossrecognition of foreign antigens (molecular mimicry)
 - **since memory T cells can be stimulated by peptide concentrations > 50 fold lower than those required to stimulate naive T cells, more likely for memory T cell to be stimulated by crossreactive peptide, pathogen-mediated priming would be required first before crossreactivity (i.e. naive T cell that lead to generation of memory T cell stimulated by pathogen first), this is consistent with infection precipitating autoimmunity**
 - **any given TCR-pMHC interaction is likely not the best TCR to bind that pMHC (affinity wise), but it's good enough to stimulate a response, this also means that the affinity can be increased for therapeutics**
# γδ T cell exhaustion: Opportunities for intervention
 - γδ T cells (TCRs with γ and δ chains instead of the usual α and β ones) can respond to varied infections/tumor challenges in a non-MHC-restricted manner, involved in immune surveillance (pleiotropic i.e. more than one effector functions)
