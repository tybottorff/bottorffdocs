1) Read literature, find publicly available data (**scRNAseq + TCRseq**, like 10X) to mine
 - for example papers Peter shared initially in box
 - check around GEO
 - Cellular and molecular waypoints along the path of T cell exhaustion

2) Reproduce their findings / practice coding
 - a couple figures/dataset
 - use Erin's code
 - (old) BRI R coding challenges

3) Use their data to answer what's not yet answered in grant, exploratory analysis of what they may have missed
 - relationship between clonal expansion and outcomes (irAEs)
 - TCRs of expanding cells: are they longer/shorter, more or less germline-like? won't know antigen specificity but can checkout sequence? something special about TCRs of expanding T cells that can predict irAE outcome?
 - big question: do we see expanded cells regardless of antigen specificity? what happens to expanded cells after treatment? do they persist? keep expanding? move to a specific tissue? are these expanded cells related to irAEs?
 - hypothesis: we will find polyclonal expansion in databases we are mining of ICI treated patients
 - use Erin's code
