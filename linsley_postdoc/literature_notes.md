# T-cell invigoration to tumour burden ratio associated with anti-PD-1 response
## Abstract
### Background
 - monotherapies based on PD-1 (programmed cell death) blockade (i.e. T cell reinvigoration) have been successful in durably treating some but not most melanoma patients
 - pre-existing T cell infiltration into tumor, presence of PD-L1 in tumors can be used as indicators of clinical responses (*guessing positive and negative prognosis respectively without PD-1 blockade treatment and both positive for PD-1 blockade*), although these indicators are not optimal, *need for better predictors of PD-1 blockade treatment effectiveness*
### Gap in field
 - immune blood profiling based understanding of PD-1 blockade mechanisms
### Methods
 - immune peripheral blood profiling of stage IV melanoma patients before/after PD-1 blockade (targeting antibody, pembrolizumab)
### Results
 - changes in circulating exhausted CD8 T cells
 - most patients show immune response to PD-1 blockade (pembrolizumab)
 - clinical failure mostly from imbalance between T cell reinvigoration and tumor burden
 - clinical response correlates with magnitude of T cell reinvigoration (relative to predrug burden)
 - *profile mechanistically relevant subpopulation of circulating T cells calibrated to predrug disease burden, able to identify clinically accessible predictor of PD-1 blockade treatment outcome*
 - *I'm curious how the calibration works above*
## Introduction
 - PD-L1 (ligand or PD-1 inhibitory receptor) expression in tumors suppress T cell response --> dysfunctional/exhausted T cells
 - exhausted T cells are less effective and exhibit distinct transcriptional profile compared to effector and memory CD8 T cells (*what I assume from it being said they have distinct differentiation patterns*)
 - *major challenge is knowing who will benefit from PD-1 blockade and who won't before giving the antibody treatment*
 - *goal: use peripheral blood profiling to detect responses to checkpoint (PD-1) blockade, identify relevant cell types... to better predict who will and who won't benefit from PD-1 blockade*
## Results
### Healthy donor vs. melanoma patients
 - all patients previously had anti-CTLA-4 therapy (a different checkpoint blockade treatment analogous to PD-1 blockade)
 - most patients didn't do well with PD-1 blockade (as measured by RECIST criteria guidelines)
 - comparative methods: flow cytometry (see frequencies of CD4, CD8 T cells, memory T cell subsets, co-expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors like PD-1, CTLA-4, 2B4, TIM-3 with CD4 or CD8), *perhaps high coexpression of PD-1 for example with CD4 and CD8 in T cells indicates likely exhaustion and therefore a good response to PD-1 blockade with reinvigoration of T cells, but later they see that anti PD-1 immune response isn't good predictor of clinical response*
 - evidence for prior immune response in melanoma patients (vs. healthy controls): higher CD4+ FOXP3+  (*Treg marker*) T cell frequency, higher Ki67 expression by FOXP3+ cells, Ki67 higher in CD8 T cells in melanoma patients especially in PD-1+ CD8 T cell subset, *higher proliferation (Ki67 is proliferation marker, also marks T cell reinvigoration, seems reasonable that exhausted T cells proliferate slower) and frequency of certain T cells (FOX3P is Treg marker, and Tregs suppress immune responses*)
### Pharmacodynamic immune response to anti PD-1
 - frequency of Ki67+ CD8 T cells goes up then down with PD-1 blockade treatment (figure 1B: count of cells with Ki67+ over some threshold)
 - cytotoxic, proliferating Ki67+ CD8 T cell population CD45RA low (*not sure of significance*), CD27 high (*CD27 low is effector T cell*), CTLA-4 and PD-1 high (immune checkpoints), 2B4 high (*not sure of significance*), Eomes high and T-bet low which *seems to* indicate a exhausted T cell phenotype
 - healthy patient Ki67+ (proliferating) population largely Eomes high T-bet high (effector T cell phenotype), *so melanoma patients have more exhausted T cells than healthy patients, makes sense with consistent immune response to melanoma that expresses inhibitory receptors*
 - increased proliferation from treatment most evident in PD-1+ CD8 T cells (*evidence of immune response to PD-1 blockade*)
 - 74% of patients had PD-1 immune response, but only 38% had clinical response, *so anti PD-1 immune response is not a good predictor of clinical response*
### Reinvigorated Texhausted cells detected in peripheral blood
 - do CD8 PD-1+ CTLA-4+ T cells provide greater precision in tracking effects of PD-1 blockade? they seem to be mostly Eomes high T-bet low and CD45RA low CD27 high, *exhausted phenotype?*
 - also see increased Ki67 expression in these cells from treatment (50% Ki67+ before treatment --> 75% Ki67+ after treatment), much lower Ki67 expression in PD-1+ CTLA-4- T cells (*so T cells expressing both inhibitory receptors are more reinvigorated from exhaustion?*)
 - *takeaway seems to be the more inhibitory receptors a T cell expresses, the more the cell responds to anti-PD-1 therapy, i.e. reinvigorate from exhausted state*
 - methods: mass cytometry (like flow cytometry but use heavy metal ion labeled antibodies instead of fluorochromes to get many more parameters and high dimensionally analyze single cells) and RNAseq
 - see PD-1 expressed by exhausted T cells, but also by memory (CCR7 high) and effector (CD27 low) T cells
