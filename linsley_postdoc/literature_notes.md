# T-cell invigoration to tumour burden ratio associated with anti-PD-1 response
## Abstract
### Background
 - monotherapies based on PD-1 (programmed cell death) blockade (i.e. T cell reinvigoration) have been successful in durably treating some but not most melanoma patients
 - pre-existing T cell infiltration into tumor, presence of PD-L1 in tumors can be used as indicators of clinical responses (*guessing positive and negative prognosis respectively without PD-1 blockade treatment and both positive for PD-1 blockade*), although these indicators are not optimal, *need for better predictors of PD-1 blockade treatment effectiveness*
### Gap in field
 - immune blood profiling based understanding of PD-1 blockade mechanisms
### Methods
 - immune peripheral blood profiling of stage IV melanoma patients before/after PD-1 blockade (targeting antibody, pembrolizumab)
### Results
 - changes in circulating exhausted CD8 T cells
 - most patients show immune response to PD-1 blockade (pembrolizumab)
 - clinical failure mostly from imbalance between T cell reinvigoration and tumor burden
 - clinical response correlates with magnitude of T cell reinvigoration (relative to predrug burden)
 - *profile mechanistically relevant subpopulation of circulating T cells calibrated to predrug disease burden, able to identify clinically accessible predictor of PD-1 blockade treatment outcome*
 - *I'm curious how the calibration works above*
## Introduction
 - PD-L1 (ligand or PD-1 inhibitory receptor) expression in tumors suppress T cell response --> dysfunctional/exhausted T cells
 - exhausted T cells are less effective and exhibit distinct transcriptional profile compared to effector and memory CD8 T cells (*what I assume from it being said they have distinct differentiation patterns*)
 - *major challenge is knowing who will benefit from PD-1 blockade and who won't before giving the antibody treatment*
 - *goal: use peripheral blood profiling to detect responses to checkpoint (PD-1) blockade, identify relevant cell types... to better predict who will and who won't benefit from PD-1 blockade*
## Results
### Healthy donor vs. melanoma patients
 - all patients previously had anti-CTLA-4 therapy (a different checkpoint blockade treatment analogous to PD-1 blockade)
 - most patients didn't do well with PD-1 blockade (as measured by RECIST criteria guidelines)
 - comparative methods: flow cytometry (see frequencies of CD4, CD8 T cells, memory T cell subsets, co-expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors like PD-1, CTLA-4, 2B4, TIM-3 with CD4 or CD8), *perhaps high coexpression of PD-1 for example with CD4 and CD8 in T cells indicates likely exhaustion and therefore a good response to PD-1 blockade with reinvigoration of T cells*
 - evidence for prior immune response in melanoma patients (vs. healthy controls): higher CD4+ FOXP3+ T cell frequency, higher Ki67 expression by FOXP3+ cells, Ki67 higher in CD8 T cells in melanoma patients especially in PD-1+ CD8 T cell subset, *higher proliferation (Ki67 is proliferation marker, also marks T cell reinvigoration, seems reasonable that exhausted T cells proliferate slower) and frequency of certain T cells (FOX3P is Treg marker, and Tregs suppress immune responses*)
