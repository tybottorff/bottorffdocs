# A phenotypically and functionally distinct human TH2 cell subpopulation is associated with allergic disorders
 - allergen-specific type 2 helper T (TH2) cells critical in initiating/orchestrating allergic/asthmatic inflammatory response pathways
 - currently lack methodology to identify and differentiate these cells from nonpathogenic TH2 cell types (otherwise would be able to use them as therapeutic targets and biomarkers)
 - here, they describe a subset of human memory TH2 cells confined to atopic (hypersensitivity reaction occurs in part of body not in contact with allergen) individuals that includes all allergen-specific TH2 cells, denoted as TH2A cells, characterized by coexpression of CRTH2, CD49d, and CD161 and exhibit numerous functional attributes distinct from conventional TH2 cells
 - transcriptome analysis reveals distinct pathway in initiation of pathogenic responses to allergen
 - elimination of these cells is indicative of clinical responses induced by immunotherapy
# Cellular and molecular waypoints along the path of T cell exhaustion
# Characterization of Thyroid Disorders in Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibition Therapy
 - thyroid disorders are a common irAE following ICI
# Coregultion of CD8+ T cell exhaustion by multiple inhibitory receptors during chronic viral infection
 - coexpression of multiple distinct inhibitory receptors associated with greater T cell exhaustion and more severe infection (in context of chronic infection causing T cell exhaustion)
 - blockade of T cell inhibitory receptors PD-1, LAG-3 reinvigorate T cells
# Correlation between vitiligo occurrence and clinical benefit in advanced melanoma patients treated with nivolumab: A multi-institutional retrospective study
 - occasionally see vitiligo in melanoma patients
 - some propose correlation between vitiligo occurence and clinical response in melanoma patients receiving immunotherapy, but most studies have included heterogeneous patient and treatment settings
 - goal: investigate correlation between vitiligo occurence and clinical benefit of immunotherapy
 - results: vitiligo occurence correlated with favorable clinical outcome
# Distinct cellular mechanisms underlie anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade
 - goal: elucidate mechanism by which ICI (immune checkpoint inhibitors) induce tumor rejection
 - mass cytometry approach to profile effects of ICI on tumor immune infiltrates in human melanoma and murine tumor models
 - results: ICI targets subsets of tumor infiltrating T cells
 - *PD-1 blockade predominantly induces expansion of speciifc tumor infiltrating exhausted-like CD8+ T cell subsets*
 - *CTLA-4 blockade induces expansion of ICOS+ Th1-like CD4+ effector T cells, also engages specific subsets of exhausted-like CD8+ T cells*
 - *different ICI target different T cell subsets*
# Divergent clonal differentiation trajectories of T cell exhaustion
 - chronic antigen exposure leads to T cell exhaustion with reduced effector function
 - do all antigen-specific T cell clones follow the same Tex differentiation trajectory?
 - results: high T cell receptor signaling aviditiy correlates with Tex terminal phenotype, low avidity correlates with effector-like Tex KLR fate (so higher signaling response from TCR activation leads to higher exhaustion)
# Identifying specificity groups in the T cell receptor repertoire
 - TCR sequences are diverse
 - here, they define the minimal requirements for TCR antigen specificity through analysis of TCR sequences using a panel of pMHC tetramer sorted cells and structural data
 - GLIPH algorithm: grouping of lymphocyte interactions by paratope hotspots, clusters TCRs with high probability of sharing specificity owing to conserved motifs and similarity of CDR3 sequences

## Abstract
 - scRNAseq + TCR-seq of tumor, normal, and lymph tissue in patients with lung cancer after ICI
 - cancer cells enriched for exhausted CD8+ T cells, CD4+ Tregs, follicular CD4+ T helper cells
 - the exhausted CD8+ tumor-specific T cells and follicular T helper cells were clonally linked to TCF7+ SELL+ progenitors in tumor draining lymph nodes
## Introduction
 - ICI can work via activation, expansion, and recruitment of CD8+ T cells from peripheral circulation
 - open questions: are there phenotypic differences between clonally related T cells in different anatomical sites? are progenitor exhausted T cells clonally linked to intratumoral exhausted CD8+ T cells present in tumor-draining lymph nodes (seems to be the case in mice)? how long do tumor specific T cell clones like exhausted CD8+ T cells persist after ICI?
# Mechanisms of tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade and combination strategies to overcome resistance
# Quantifiable predictive features define epitope-specific T cell receptor repertoires
 - TCR is heterodimer, mediates pathogen-associated epitope recognition through interactions between peptide and MHC, generated by genomic rearrangement of germline TCR locus (VDJ recombination) to allow potentially 10^15 to 10^61 unique receptors
 - TCRs from T cells that recognize the same pMHC epitope often share conserved sequence features, perhaps able to predict model epitope specificity
 - here, they study CD8+ TCRs in mice and humans to study these conserved features as well as features differentiating them
# Single-cell RNA-seq reveals expanded clones of islet antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood of subjects with type 1 diabetes
 - unclear significance of islet antigen reactive T cells in peripheral blood of T1D patients (similar cells in healthy control subjects)
 - hypothesis: key disease associated cells show evidence of prior antigen exposure, inferred from expanded TCR clonotypes and essential phenotypic properties in their transcriptomes
 - testing hypothesis: scRNAseq to identify TCR clonotypes and transcript phenotypes, apply analysis to islet antigen reactive CD4+ memory T cells from T1D and healthy control subjects following activation with pooled islet peptides
 - TCR results: extensive TCR clonotype sharing in antigen activated cells especially from T1D subjects, consistent with in vivo T cell expansion during disease progression, stable clonotypes (detect at repeat visits), see no clonotype sharing between subjects ("private" TCR specificities), IGRP seems to be a trigger for CD4+ T cell expansion (recognized by expanded clones from two T1D subjects)
 - transcript results: overall transcript profiles from healthy controls and T1D subjects similar, most expanded clone profiles distinctive though
# Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals distinct T cell populations in immune-related adverse events of checkpoint inhibitors
## Abstract
 - different subsets of T cells are associated with irAEs, can use these cells before ICI treatment as biomarkers to predict irAEs
 - for example, patients with immune-related arthritis have lower levels of CD8 TCM (central memory) cells at baseline, patients with immune-related pneumonitis have more CD4 TH2 (subset of T helper cells that mediate activation/maintenance of antibody-mediated immune response against parasites, bacteria, allergens, toxins) cells at baseline, and patients with immune-related thyroiditis have more  CD4 TH17 (secrete IL-17A cytokine, involved in defense at mucosal/epithelial barriers) cells at baseline
 - about half of patients develop irAEs from PD-1 blockade
 - methods: they use the K-nearest neighbor-based network graph-drawing layout to investigate subpopulations of T cells
## Introduction
 - prior history of autoimmune disease is one predictor of irAEs
 - perplexingly, irAEs are often organ specific (i.e. different patients have different affected organs)
 - methods: scRNAseq of peripheral blood T cells before/after ICI, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes sequencing (CITE-seq, simultaneously quantify cell surface protein and transcriptomic data within single cells using oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies) to stratify CD4 and CD8 T cells by naive and effector phenotypes, define molecular/cellular changes associated with T cell transition from self-tolerant to sensitized effector cells
## Results
### Dimensionality reduction approach to visualize scRNAseq data of patients with irAEs
 - able to see some dominant clusters among patients developing irAEs
 - some clusters show changes in relative percentages of cell populations before/after ICI
### Gene marker based cluster annotation identifies effector, regulatory, and memory subsets of peripheral T cells
 - 14/25 clusters express CD3E, 6 of which were dominated by CD8A and 8 by CD4
 - naive CD8 T cells characterized by CD45RA, CCR7, SELL (CD62L0, LEF1)
 - central memory CD8 T cells contain CCR7, SELL, CD27 as well as CD44, CXCR3, FAS, CD28
 - subset of effector CD8 T cells express TBX21, cytotoxic markers like GZMB, KLRD1, PRF1, CD3E
 - effector memory CD8 T cells display EMOS, GZMK, IFNG
 - mucosal-associated invariant T cells in all patients
 - CD8 T helper cells express GATA3
## Methods
## Discussion
# Successful treatment of arthritis induced by checkpoint inhibitors with tocilizumab: a case series
 - irAEs are inflammatory side effects from ICIs
 - ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis has been reported
 - corticosteroids can treat mild irAEs, TNFÎ± inhibitors reserved for severe cases (prolonged TNFÎ± inhibitor use can negatively impact antitumor effect of ICI)
 - here, they try instead to use the anti IL6 receptor antibody (FDA approved to treat RA) for ICI-induced arthritis
# T cell characteristics associated with toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade in patients with melanoma
## Abstract
 - irAEs in 10-60% of patients with melanoma treated with ICI
 - does a common baseline immunological state precede irAE?
 - methods: mass cytometry, scRNAseq, single cell V(D)J sequencing, bulk RNAseq, bulk TCR sequencing to study peripheral blood from melanoma patients treated with PD-1 blockade (+/- CTLA-4 blockade)
 - activated CD4 memory T abundance and TCR diversity associated with irAE
## Introduction
 - SNP in microRNA-146a (regulates innate immunity, inflammation, antiviral pathway) linked with irAE
 - pre-existing autoantibodies, autoreactive tissue-reisdent T cells, and T cells with specificity for viral antigens (from chronic viral infections) also implicated in irAE
 - gut microbiome changes (leading to increased colonic IL-1ÃŸ) also linked with irAE
## Results
### Determinants of severe irAEs from pretreatment blood
 - CD4 effector memory T cells at higher levels in pretreatment blood associated with severe irAE
# T-cell invigoration to tumour burden ratio associated with anti-PD-1 response
## Abstract
### Background
 - monotherapies based on PD-1 (programmed cell death) blockade (i.e. T cell reinvigoration) have been successful in durably treating some but not most melanoma patients
 - pre-existing T cell infiltration into tumor, presence of PD-L1 in tumors can be used as indicators of clinical responses (*guessing positive and negative prognosis respectively without PD-1 blockade treatment and both positive for PD-1 blockade*), although these indicators are not optimal, *need for better predictors of PD-1 blockade treatment effectiveness*
### Gap in field
 - immune blood profiling based understanding of PD-1 blockade mechanisms
### Methods
 - immune peripheral blood profiling of stage IV melanoma patients before/after PD-1 blockade (targeting antibody, pembrolizumab)
### Results
 - changes in circulating exhausted CD8 T cells
 - most patients show immune response to PD-1 blockade (pembrolizumab)
 - clinical failure mostly from imbalance between T cell reinvigoration and tumor burden
 - clinical response correlates with magnitude of T cell reinvigoration (relative to predrug burden)
 - *profile mechanistically relevant subpopulation of circulating T cells calibrated to predrug disease burden, able to identify clinically accessible predictor of PD-1 blockade treatment outcome*
 - *I'm curious how the calibration works above*
## Introduction
 - PD-L1 (ligand or PD-1 inhibitory receptor) expression in tumors suppress T cell response --> dysfunctional/exhausted T cells
 - exhausted T cells are less effective and exhibit distinct transcriptional profile compared to effector and memory CD8 T cells (*what I assume from it being said they have distinct differentiation patterns*)
 - *major challenge is knowing who will benefit from PD-1 blockade and who won't before giving the antibody treatment*
 - *goal: use peripheral blood profiling to detect responses to checkpoint (PD-1) blockade, identify relevant cell types... to better predict who will and who won't benefit from PD-1 blockade*
## Results
### Healthy donor vs. melanoma patients
 - all patients previously had anti-CTLA-4 therapy (a different checkpoint blockade treatment analogous to PD-1 blockade)
 - most patients didn't do well with PD-1 blockade (as measured by RECIST criteria guidelines)
 - comparative methods: flow cytometry (see frequencies of CD4, CD8 T cells, memory T cell subsets, co-expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors like PD-1, CTLA-4, 2B4, TIM-3 with CD4 or CD8), *perhaps high coexpression of PD-1 for example with CD4 and CD8 in T cells indicates likely exhaustion and therefore a good response to PD-1 blockade with reinvigoration of T cells, but later they see that anti PD-1 immune response isn't good predictor of clinical response*
 - evidence for prior immune response in melanoma patients (vs. healthy controls): higher CD4+ FOXP3+  (*Treg marker*) T cell frequency, higher Ki67 expression by FOXP3+ cells, Ki67 higher in CD8 T cells in melanoma patients especially in PD-1+ CD8 T cell subset, *higher proliferation (Ki67 is proliferation marker, also marks T cell reinvigoration, seems reasonable that exhausted T cells proliferate slower) and frequency of certain T cells (FOX3P is Treg marker, and Tregs suppress immune responses*)
### Pharmacodynamic immune response to anti PD-1
 - frequency of Ki67+ CD8 T cells goes up then down with PD-1 blockade treatment (figure 1B: count of cells with Ki67+ over some threshold)
 - cytotoxic, proliferating Ki67+ CD8 T cell population CD45RA low (*not sure of significance*), CD27 high (*CD27 low is effector T cell*), CTLA-4 and PD-1 high (immune checkpoints), 2B4 high (*not sure of significance*), Eomes high and T-bet low which *seems to* indicate a exhausted T cell phenotype
 - healthy patient Ki67+ (proliferating) population largely Eomes high T-bet high (effector T cell phenotype), *so melanoma patients have more exhausted T cells than healthy patients, makes sense with consistent immune response to melanoma that expresses inhibitory receptors*
 - increased proliferation from treatment most evident in PD-1+ CD8 T cells (*evidence of immune response to PD-1 blockade*)
 - 74% of patients had PD-1 immune response, but only 38% had clinical response, *so anti PD-1 immune response is not a good predictor of clinical response*
### Reinvigorated Texhausted cells detected in peripheral blood
 - do CD8 PD-1+ CTLA-4+ T cells provide greater precision in tracking effects of PD-1 blockade? they seem to be mostly Eomes high T-bet low and CD45RA low CD27 high, *exhausted phenotype?*
 - also see increased Ki67 expression in these cells from treatment (50% Ki67+ before treatment --> 75% Ki67+ after treatment), much lower Ki67 expression in PD-1+ CTLA-4- T cells (*so T cells expressing both inhibitory receptors are more reinvigorated from exhaustion?*)
 - *takeaway seems to be the more inhibitory receptors a T cell expresses, the more the cell responds to anti-PD-1 therapy, i.e. reinvigorate from exhausted state*
 - methods: mass cytometry (like flow cytometry but use heavy metal ion labeled antibodies instead of fluorochromes to get many more parameters and high dimensionally analyze single cells) and RNAseq
 - see PD-1 expressed by exhausted T cells, but also by memory (CCR7 high) and effector (CD27 low) T cells
 - see population of cells expressing exhaustion markers (Eomes, CD39) that increased in frequency and Ki67 expression after PD-1 blockade (reinvigoration), express granzymes (cytotoxic T cell method of killing target cells by inducing apoptosis)
### Responding T-cell clones from blood found in tumor
 - the reinvigorated Tex cells in blood are also found in tumor
### T-cell reinvigoration correlates with tumor burden
 - antigen burden key determinant of exhaustion severity and reinvigoration by PD-1 blockade, want to test if that is true here in melanoma
 - evidence of pre-existing CD8 T cell response related to tumor burden, augmented by PD-1 blockade
### Reinvigoration/tumor ratio affects clinical outcome
 - perhaps larger baseline immune responses correlate with clinical response
 - however, higher pre-treatment Ki67 (proliferation) levels in PD-1+ CD8 T cells was associated with poor prognosis
 - rather, perhaps a larger baseline immune response may reflect a higher tumor burden that is itself indicates poor prognosis
 - Ki67 levels don't correlate with clinical outcome alone, so rather than reinvigoration magnitude, perhaps its the exhausted T cell:tumor burden ratio that better predicts clinical response
## Discussion
 - most patients have an on-target immunological, detectable effect of PD-1 blockade on CD8 T cells
 - see exhausted T cells as major target of PD-1 blockade (reinvigoration)
 - most patients have a single peak of PD-1 blockade-induced immune reinvigoration despite on-going treatment
 - responding exhausted T cells in blood contain TCR clonotypes shared with tumor infiltrating T cells
 - ratio of exhausted T cell reinvigoration to tumor burden predicts clinical response
