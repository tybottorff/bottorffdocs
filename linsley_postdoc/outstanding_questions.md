1) so the main goals outlined in the grant are a) to find T cell predictive cell biomarkers (likely specific autoreactive T cell frequencies/phenotypes) for irAE onset (which it seems to me that some research has already been done on, **so I was struggling a bit to find our place here**), b) find predictors as well for outcome of ICI treatment (**which has also been investigated but not for all co-inhibitory receptor blockades or we are trying to generalize across all of them or...?**), and c) to see if these predictive biomarkers for irAE onset relate to markers for clinical response/ICI efficacy (this I haven't seen studied as much so I understand the novelty here)

2) **do we think that the frequency/phenotype of self-reactive T cells will predict both irAEs and therapeutic efficacy because of reactivity towards antigens shared between cancer and self?** I'm not sure how broad the overlap is in between antigens presented by tumor and self

3) for the investigation into how well irAE development and clinical response correlate (which it seems to generally correlate based on the literature? perhaps mechanism being if there's an immune response it's activated both against tumor and self even if not targeting the same antigen i.e. a shared antigen), is one possible reason for them not correlating that a subset of patients have subclinical/latent autoimmune states that are unmasked upon ICI (this I don't think would relate to/correlate with clinical response of ICI)?

4) is there data from the grant that I can/should analyze (what I think is true based on grant methods i.e. the sequential CD154/GARP/CD137 assay)? or should I be working with online publically available data (not just to practice reproducing figures with, which is what I understood from our conversations so far?)
