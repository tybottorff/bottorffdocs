 - don't treat irAEs and autoimmune diseases as the same
# 9/15/23 Peter and Nidhi meeting
 - 10X can yield scRNAseq and TCRseq from the same cells
 - antigen specific cells are very rare (1 in 100,000), so 10,000 cells for 10X for example isn't enough (need to enrich first)
 - want to understand relationship/be able to predict irAE and clinical response, i.e. if just going to get irAE no sense in giving ICI
 - CD45RA marks naive cells, CD45RO marks memory cells
 - ICI usually given in 3 week cycles
 - there are more CD8 specific antigen cells than CD4 antigen specific cells, **why?**
 - find that their TAA reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> expanded antigen specific T cells are oliog/monoclonal (not diverse in terms of their TCR sequences)
 - big question: do we see expanded cells regardless of antigen specificity? what happens to expanded cells after treatment? do they persist? keep expanding? move to a specific tissue? are these expanded cells related to irAEs?
 - hypothesis: we will find polyclonal expansion in databases we are mining of ICI treated patients
