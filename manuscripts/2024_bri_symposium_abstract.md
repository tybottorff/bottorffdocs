Abstract (character limit 1484/1500):
 
T cell exhaustion, a state of reduced effector function, results from chronic stimulation from antigens that cannot be fully cleared.
In recent T1D studies, levels of TIGIT<sup>+</sup>KLRG1<sup>+</sup> (DP) PD-1<sup>+</sup> and DP CD57<sup>+</sup> exhausted CD8s early after treatment have correlated with better response to therapy, consistent with the reduced effector function of these exhausted T cells.
However, levels of DP CD127<sup>+</sup> exhausted CD8s may in fact correlate with worse outcome in T1D.
To investigate this heterogeneity in association with response to therapy amongst DP exhausted CD8s and given the epigenetic changes that characterize T cell exhaustion, here we profiled the epigenetic states of different non-naive CD8 populations from PBMCs of 10 T1D patients treated with teplizumab using bulk ATAC-seq.
We found that the epigenetic states of DP CD127<sup>+</sup> CD8s were intermediate to that of other DP CD8s (PD-1<sup>+</sup> and CD57<sup>+</sup>) and TIGIT<sup>-</sup>KLRG1<sup>-</sup> CD8s.
We also analyzed mitochondrial-mapping ATAC-seq reads and found that the DP CD8s had more mitochondrial single nucleotide variants than DN CD8s with DP CD57<sup>+</sup> specifically having the most variants.
We hypothesize that non-naive CD8 differentiation flows from DP CD127<sup>+</sup> to DP PD-1<sup>+</sup> to the more terminal DP CD57<sup>+</sup>.
<!-- This separation of the DP CD127<sup>+</sup> lineage from other DPs lineage is consistent with the observed heterogeneity in association with response to therapy and the possible protective effect of IL7R blockade against autoimmune diabetes. -->
