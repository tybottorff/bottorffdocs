T cell exhaustion, a state of reduced proliferative potential and cytokine production and increased expression of inhibitory receptors, results from chronic antigen stimulation and the inability to fully clear antigens.
T cell exhaustion is characterized by expression of various transcription factors as well as epigenetic changes.
Certain subsets of TIGIT<sup>+</sup>KLRG1<sup>+</sup> (henceforth double positive, DP) exhausted T cells, specifically PD-1<sup>+</sup> or CD57<sup>+</sup> ones, have been shown to be associated with improved response to therapy and slower progression to disease in type 1 diabetes, consistent with the reduced effector function of these exhausted T cells.
However, DP CD127<sup>+</sup> exhausted T cells have been shown to be associated with worse outcome in T1D, displaying a heterogeneity even amongst DP exhausted T cells.
To investigate this heterogeneity, here, we profiled the epigenetic states of different non-naive DP CD8 populations from PBMCs of T1D patients treated with teplizumab, a humanized anti-CD3 mAb that delays progression to T1D, using bulk ATAC-seq.
We found that the epigenetic states of DP CD127<sup>+</sup> CD8s were intermediate to that of other DP CD8s and TIGIT<sup>-</sup>KLRG1<sup>-</sup> CD8s while the epigenetic states of DP CD57<sup>+</sup> CD8s were more distinct.
From analysis of "by-product" mitochondrial-mapping reads from this ATAC-seq analysis, we also found that these DP CD57<sup>+</sup> CD8s had more mitochondrial single nucleotide variants than other DP CD8s, suggesting that they were more terminal in their differentiation.
