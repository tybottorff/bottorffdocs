T cell exhaustion, a state of reduced proliferative potential and cytokine production and increased expression of inhibitory receptors, results from stimulation from chronic antigen that are unabled to be fully cleared.
Certain subsets of TIGIT<sup>+</sup>KLRG1<sup>+</sup> (henceforth double positive, DP) exhausted T cells, specifically PD-1<sup>+</sup> and CD57<sup>+</sup> ones, have been shown to be associated with improved response to therapy and slower progression to disease in type 1 diabetes, consistent with the reduced effector function of these exhausted T cells.
However, DP CD127<sup>+</sup> exhausted T cells have been shown to be associated with worse outcome in T1D, displaying a heterogeneity in association with response  amongst DP exhausted T cells.
To investigate this heterogeneity given the epigenetic changes that characterize T cell exhaustion, here we profiled the epigenetic states of different non-naive DP CD8 populations from PBMCs of T1D patients treated with teplizumab, a humanized anti-CD3 mAb that delays progression to T1D, using bulk ATAC-seq.
We found that the epigenetic states of DP CD127<sup>+</sup> CD8s were intermediate to that of other DP CD8s and TIGIT<sup>-</sup>KLRG1<sup>-</sup> CD8s.
Given our interest in the relations between these cell sorts, we analyzed mitochondrial-mapping and found that the DP CD57<sup>+</sup> CD8s had more mitochondrial single nucleotide variants than other non-naive CD8s, suggesting that they were more terminal in their differentiation.
