# TODOs
1. **IMPACD**
 - ask Alice W. to manually gate top hits to verify
 - fix TCF7 gate
 - validate to make sure % parents are good on subset + modifier
 - analyze results locally
 - 1 subset wasn't run but not big priority to re-run whole posit thing just for it
2. response
 - group response types to binary, or at least remove stable disease and just look progressive vs. partial response
 - continuous progression using dates?
3. longitudinal analyses
 - align to time of irAE rather than baseline
4. HLA type info?
5. use data from internal controls in each batch to inform/assist in batch correction (especially as batch 7, fig below, shows more skewing pre-batch correction and is the one batch with no representation from both irAE groups), goal here is to reduce removal of biological signal that may be happening currently
6. look at ratio of IRs to activation markers
