# TODOs
1. **IMPACD**
 - ask Alice W. to manually gate top hits to verify
 - fix TCF7 gate
 - validate to make sure % parents are good on subset + modifier
 - analyze results locally
 - 1 subset wasn't run but not big priority to re-run whole posit thing just for it
2. response
 - group response types to binary, or at least remove stable disease and just look progressive vs. partial response
 - continuous progression using dates?
3. longitudinal analyses
 - align to time of irAE rather than baseline
4. HLA type info?
5. use data from internal controls in each batch to inform/assist in batch correction (especially as batch 7, fig below, shows more skewing pre-batch correction and is the one batch with no representation from both irAE groups), goal here is to reduce removal of biological signal that may be happening currently
6. look at ratio of IRs to activation markers

IMPACD
debug subsets that failed validation the worst
PDL1+ classical monocytes
CCR6+, CCR4+ of NN Tconv CD4s (very relevant for CD4 Th17)
analyze results locally
summarize baseline results
re-do longitudinal w/ ordered factors
+/- benchmarking
+/- thyroid OOR inclusion
systemic vs. specific irAEs
focus on non-naive (Alice L. suggestion)
figure out how to do > 1 modifier node on a subset with ggcyto (or go back to correct method but fix??)
then can check for Bukhari, 2023 result (see subjects with thyroiditis at baseline have more CD4 Th17), use Alice W.'s definition (same as Stephan but included CCR4-): non-naive CD4 Tconv/CCR6+/CXCR5-/CXCR3-/CCR4-
check CD4:CD8 ratio given that's where results for skin longitudinal point (if pursuing given benchmarking removes this)
look at CBCs for total #s (emailed Megan S. 4/3)
may already have data on skin/thyroid AID samples elsewhere in BRI
