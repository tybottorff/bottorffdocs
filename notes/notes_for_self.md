# Key notes
## Professional
 - ***explain things clearly (motivations, methods, evidence for results, graphs, takeaways like 1/slide), don't rush through presentations***
 - speak up more in meetings
 - be in the office (not remote) as often as possible
## Biology
 - **more cytotoxic phenotype has been observed in more terminal Tex before (chronic viral/mice context likely, I forget), but they are short-lived (vs. less cytotoxic but longer-lived progenitor Tex)**
 - **IL7R blockade is depleting via starvation (selectively deplete IL7-dependent cells)**
 - **DP PD-1+ in bifurcated model as terminal Tex leading to effector Tex doesn't make the most sense...?**
 - **perhaps more specific label for DP CD127+ instead of Tpex is memory-like Tpex, especially in linear model as intermediate Tex (DP PD-1+) can be thought of as a 2nd subset of Tpex along with DP CD127+**
 - **IL7R* expression reduced with teplizumab and patients with lower CD127 expression had longer diabetes free intervals, lower CD127 expression associated with slower disease progression**
 - **terminal Tex persist worse than progenitor Tex, persist meaning time to deletion with no antigen exposure?**
 - **maybe a difference between DP PD-1+ and CD57+ is their affinities for antigen? literature idea: terminal Tex higher affinity than effector Tex**
 - **fratricide: CD8 killing CD4?**
 - **teplizumab: 1st FDA approved drug to delay T1D (up to ~2 yr delay), humanized anti-CD3 monoclonal Ab to delay onset of stage 3 T1D in people with stage 2 T1D. mechanism: weak agonist of TCR-CD3 to induce anergy/apoptosis of T cells (i.e. autoreactive Teffs I presume), temporarily induces shift of T cells from periphery to elsewhere (lymph node or bone marrow perhaps) and then when T cells return to periphery in ~1 month it's less effector memory/TEMRA that return so it looks like increased Tex % of total CD8s**
 - **IL7R high in memory precursor effector cells (those that don't die when population contracts from Teff to Tem/Tcm, so non-exhausted CD127+ likely TCM, TIGIT and KLRG1 on memory cells, CD127 on naive/early CM)**
 - **IL7 cytokine needed for memory T cell growth**
 - **TIGIT<sup>-</sup>KLRG1<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup> produce less cytokines than DP (CD127<sup>+</sup>), not sure how that fits into them associating with worse response**
 - **more accessible peaks doesn't necessarily mean more accessible genes as some peaks may be in silencers that are repressing genes**
 - **progenitor Tex give rise to terminal Tex through antigen-driven proliferation**
 - **model: early presence of antigen leads to rapid clonal expansion and high IFN-Î³ response and precursor cells differentiating into cytotoxic and exhausted subsets (related to low-affinity but prolonged antigens maintaining Tex) vs. reduced/delayed antigen stimulation results in less likely differentiation into exhaustion/effector subsets but rather promotes expansion of memory precursor subsets, possible connection to autoimmunity being more progenitor/earlier in lineage cells may be bad due to less exhaustion/less strong antigen driving differentiation into Tex?**
 - **strong antigen load early might be expected to be responded to by high affinity T cells that get exhausted, so only low affinity T cells leftover, if very strong antigen load then fewer distinct clonotypes left over (i.e. monoclonal leftover response)**
 - **TIGIT-KLRG1+ CD127+ associate with poor response, TIGIT is beneficial (CD127 drives poor outcome when TIGIT absent), TIGIT+KLRG1-CD12+CD45RA (EM) associate with good outcome, as DP CD127+ sort of do**
 - **idea for KIR+ CD8s cells being better for T1D is that they eliminate pathogenic CD4s?**
 - **IL7R blockade is depleting, maybe it works more on bad non-exhausted CD127+ cells (TIGIT-KLRG1+) than not-bad DP CD127+ cells**
 - AbATE is recent onset, and TN10 is 14 day course of teplizumab to see if it would delay/prevent stage 3 T1D (clinical diagnosis) in those with high-risk (stage 2 T1D)
 - KLRG1 is not exh-specific, it's kinda not specific to anything
 - cytolysis gene set up doesn't necessarily mean more Teff, not sure why but Peter said this
 - Progenitor Tex have intermediate PD-1 vs. high PD-1 in terminal Tex, doesn't seem consistent with CD127 progenitor... (mean coverage PD1 same in all non-DN and PD-1 doesn't appear on DP CD127+ vs. DP CD57 VP...)
 - proliferation short term boosted by teplizumab
 - AbATE is 6 month timepoint, peak response is 3 months
 - maybe teplizumab hits all sorts in R and not all sorts in NR, but then would expect higher MT SNV counts in R vs. NR which we don't really see
## Computational
 - box is mountable, ask IT if help needed
 - camelCase not snake_case
 - **draw ellipses around clusters/groups for all PCAs/UMAPs**
 - **limma > DESeq2 for less false positives, for non-simple models I should move out of Seurat/Diffbind (take normalized data) and into limma separately**
 - **try enrichR as an alternative to stringdb for online enrichment help**
 - **use beeswarm instead of jitter**
 - **manually edit legend dot sizes to be bigger**
 - **plotscale package to have square plots**
 - **BRI ggplot theme/wrapper: brigg**
 - **figures: with multiple figs on same slide keep axes same to make comparisons easy unless too many, show dots on box/violin plots (and then don't show outliers with their on 2nd points that's unnecessary)**
 - Pval = the probability of observing data as or more extreme than what we have observed given the null hypothesis is true
 - FDR = expected proportion of false positives (incorrect rejections of null hypothesis) among all rejections of null hypothesis (multiple corrections tested)
 - When downsampling, look at a couple different downsampled results (i.e. bootstrap)
 - Always regress out all covariates except for 1 of interest (like cell population, irAE status)
### IMPACD
 - immunologist manually gates markers of interest for each batch on a subset of data
 - then we run IMPACD (high performance gating that generates counts-like object kind of like RNAseq)
 - each cell ends up in multiple buckets (like CD16+, CD16+ICOS+, and CD16+ICOS+CD25+ for example could all be true for 1 cell)
 - consensus gates: identify gates with diverging definitions and device one consensus gate set/batch
 - level 1: automated gating, gating of single markers and report findings (no permutations)
 - level 2: do all permutations and gate them
 - level 3: modifier analysis (iterate over all possible permutations up to deptbh 3 under root path, remove redundant subsets i.e. root/A+/B+ = root/B+/A+, select significant level 2/3 nodes, test information gain with each modifier using ranksum test on background subtracted % values between subsets with/without modifier i.e. if root/A+/C+ scores significant test it vs. root/C+ and if root/A+/B+/C+ scores then test it vs. root/A+/C+ and root/B+/C+, select significant modifiers, adjust paths with 2 modifiers but only 1 winning node like if root/A+/B+/C+ modified significantly only by A+ then reduce to root/A+/C+)
 - need gates (.fcs files)
 - gating set is R equivalent of flowjo workspace, need to make this to make comparison, take gates and transformations from flowjo workspace and apply to .fcs files to make R gating set, to make correlation plot (to see if we can pull out gates correctly)
 - need to build (some) boolean gates (like not CD16+, CD16+ being a gate with coordinates) from scratch to not include parent
 - create gates separately for each batch
 - may run into issues with duplicate batches if script crashes then re-runs, or different root paths
 - transformations: light intensities (raw data, ~log scale), use transformations for each marker (some hyperbolic trig function) to transform data, also different for different batches/samples
