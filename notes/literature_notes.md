## Key points
 - interactions with self-peptide-MHC complexes on thymic epithelial cells crucial for thmocyte survival (positive selection) and CD4 vs. CD8 lineage commitment but can also result in negative selection (apoptosis)
 - migratory DCs carry peripheral self antigens into thymus, extend scope of intrathymically presented self antigens
## Main
### Positive selection and CD4 or CD8 lineage committment
 - in cortex of thymus
 - selection paradox: recognition of self is essential for thymocyte survival and lineage commitment but may also induce negative selection
 - **affinity model: only TCR-pMHC interactions with intermediate affinity allow positive selection and CD4 or CD8 lineage commitment (no or too low affinity leads to apoptosis due to neglect which is about 80-90% of lost thymocytes during selection and very high affinity contacts lead to apoptosis by negative selection i.e. clonal deletion)**
 - deviation of autoreactive thymocytes into Treg cells (CD25<sup>+</sup>) not explained by affinity model
 - cathepsins (lysosomal proteases) and thymus-specific serine protease alter MHC ligand repertoire presented to T cells during development, helps positive selection
### Antigen presentation in the medulla
 - transcriptional noise (low level transcription of any gene) may expose developing thymocytes to antigenic diversity of peripheral tissue (tissue-restricted antigens) without those peripheral antigens needing to be transited to thymus, not just inherent leaky gene expression but rather promiscuous gene expression and a distinct property of medullary thymic epithelial cells (1-3% of these cells express a particular tissue-restricted antigen but the cells get replace weekly changing topology of antigen expression in medulla)
# Anti-integrin αvβ6 autoantibodies are a potential biomarker for ulcerative colitis-like immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis
 - αvβ6 autoantibodies in > 90% of patients with UC, and a subset of ICI-colitis is similar to UC
 - see αvβ6 autoantibodies in ~30% of ICI-colitis patients and they have UC-like colitis (~2% of controls have these autoantibodies)
# Anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapies in cancer: mechanisms of action, efficacy, and limitations
## Cancers evade and inhibit immune responses
 - cytokines (like IL-12) also help effective T cell stimulation
 - immunoediting: selection of clones able to avoid immune system leading to tumor establishment
 - evasion mechanisms: downregulation of tumor antigens or MHC class I, use of inhibitory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), use of inhibitory Tregs, Bregs, or myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or inhibitory receptors (PD-1, CTLA-4)
## Immune exhaustion contributes to immune dysfunction in cancer
 - exhaustion can lead to deletion (following progressive loss of proliferative potential and effector functions)
## The immune checkpoint receptor CTLA-4
 - CTLA-4 expressed by Tregs, also CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upon activation, also exhausted T cells
 - CTLA-4 outcompetes CD28 for CD80/86 ligands and can remove ligands CD80/86 from APC surface via trans-endocytosis
 - CTLA-4 increases activation threshold of T cells (limits CD28-mediated signaling during antigen presentation to reduce immune responses to weak antigens like self/tumor antigens)
## The immune checkpoint receptor PD-1
 - follicular helper T cells constitutively express PD-1
 - PD-1 expressed by activated/induced T cells (TCR stimulation or cytokines like IL-2/7/15/21 or TGF-β)
 - IFN-γ upregulates PD-L1/2
## CTLA-4, PD-1, and their ligands in cancer
 - CTLA-4 expression on tumors associated with decreased survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma but increased survival in NSCLC
 - CTLA-4 blockade likely mostly impacts T cell activation in draining lymph node when CTLA-4 expressing Tregs remove CD80/86 from surface of APCs (reducing their ability to stimulate tumor-specific T cells), possibly also at tumor site as exhauted CTLA-4 expressing T cells and Tregs accumulate in tumor microenvironment
 - PD-1 blockade thought to act mainly at effector stage of immune response
## Limitations of immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - selection for tumor cells that can evade immune system (perhaps they lose MHC class I or IFN-γ response elements)
 - ICB can induce upregulation of other inhibitory receptors
# A novel immune checkpoint-related gene signature for predicting overall survival and immune status in triple-negative breast cancer
 - low-risk patients tend to have higher scores of *PD-1*, *CTLA-4*, *PD-L1*, *PD-L2*
# Antiplatelet drugs may increase the risk for checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis in advanced cancer patients
 - mechanism: changed immune landscape within tumor microenvironemnt, platelets' role in circulation and immune system being disturbed
 - platelet-derived PD-L1 reported to promote immune evasion and contribute to tumor growth by inhibiting CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes
# A single-cell map of intratumoral changes during anti-PD1 treatment of patients with breast cancer
 - 1/3 of tumors had PD-1 expressing T cells, clonally expand with PD-1 blockade, mostly CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with cytotoxic activity, immune-cell homing (*CXCL13*), and exhaustion markers (*LAG3*, *HAVCR2*) and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with Th1 (*IFNG*) and follicular helper (*BCL6*, *CXCR5*) signatures
# A phenotypically and functionally distinct human T<sub>H2</sub> cell subpopulation is associated with allergic disorders
 - allergen-specific type 2 helper T (T<sub>H2</sub>) cells critical in initiating/orchestrating allergic/asthmatic inflammatory response pathways
 - currently lack methodology to identify and differentiate these cells from nonpathogenic T<sub>H2</sub> cell types (otherwise would be able to use them as therapeutic targets and biomarkers)
 - here, they describe a subset of human memory T<sub>H2</sub> cells confined to atopic (hypersensitivity reaction occurs in part of body not in contact with allergen) individuals that includes all allergen-specific T<sub>H2</sub> cells, denoted as T<sub>H2A</sub> cells, characterized by co-expression of CRTH2, CD49d, and CD161 and exhibit numerous functional attributes distinct from conventional T<sub>H2</sub> cells
 - transcriptome analysis reveals distinct pathway in initiation of pathogenic responses to allergen
 - elimination of these cells is indicative of clinical responses induced by immunotherapy
# A potential mechanism of anticancer immune response coincident with immune-related adverse events in patients with renal cell carcinoma
 - **n = 5, renal cell carcinoma patients, PBMCs before combination ICI and at onset of severe irAEs, potential dataset although not sure what to use as control (no non-irAE group) and can't find data to access**
 - **CD8:FOXP3, GZMB:CD3, perforin 1:CD3, and PD-1:CD8 expression ratios higher at irAE onset**
 - **find expansion of some clones in metastases after irAEs (and see these clones increased in PBMCs at irAE onset)**
# Application of ATAC-seq in tumor-specific T cell exhaustion
 - ICB limitations: short-term nature of therapeutic effects, high individual heterogeneity
 - ICB can only temporarily restore function of some exhausted T cells because of irreversible change in epigenetics of some terminally exhausted T cells
 - exhausted T cells lose effector functions, change epigenetic/transcriptional profiles, change metabolism, slow down proliferation, and respond more slowly to stimuli due to cytokine (IL-2, TNF, IFN-γ) deficiency
 - TOX is key inducer of T cell exhaustion, NFAT (upstream target of TOX) is key regulator of T cell exhaustion
# Assessment of human leukocyte antigen-based neoantigen presentation to determine pan-cancer response to immunotherapy
 - integration of binding affinity of neoantigens to HLA-I and HLA-I allele divergence = HLA tumor-antigen presentation score (HAPS)

 - irAEs associated with higher objective response rate, longer survival
# Association between immune-related adverse events during anti-PD-1 therapy and tumor mutaitonal burden
 - higher irAE risk with higher number of somatic mutations/megabase DNA (TMB), explaining ~50% of irAE risk here
 - **model here: perhaps with more neoantigens (with higher TMB), more often activate T cells that can crossreact against more different self-antigens, basically tumor with more different antigens leading to more often off-target T cell activation against self**

# Association of checkpoint inhibitor-induced toxic effects with shared cancer and tissue antigens in non-small cell lung cancer
 - irAEs more common in patients with complete/partial remission than in those with progressive/stable disease, **autoimmune adverse effects are associated with response to therapy**
 - **identify 9 T cell antigens shared between tumor and skin (including desmocollin 3, keratin 6, mapsin, LL37, keratin 14), different from crossreactivity hypothesis seems to just be exact same antigen shared between tumor and self**, these antigens stimulate T cells *in vitro* (significant for CD8<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> but not CD4<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> T cells)
 - **seems like most similar self tissue to tumor has highest chance of irAE, skin second most similar to NSCLC after lung and had second highest proportion of irAEs**
 - **see dense infiltration of T cells in sites of irAEs**
 - **same T cell clonotypes infiltrated both lung tumor and autoimmune skin lesions**
 - **not all tumors harbor potent neoantigens, effective immunotherapy favors neoantigens**
# Association of immune-related adverse events with nivolumab efficacy in non-small-cell lung cancer
 - irAEs observed in 51% of patients (9% grades 3 or 4 i.e. severe irAEs)

# ATAC-seq: a method for assaying chromatin accessibility genome-wide

 - alternative to DNase-seq for chromatin accessibility and MNase-seq for nucleosome positioning
 - ATAC-seq can use less cells than other methods and can assay multiple chromatin features at the same time (i.e. nucleosome, TF binding, chromatin accessibility)
# ATAC-seq normalization method can significantly affect differential accessibility analysis and interpretation
 - takehome: should use multiple normalization methods to compare results
 - differentially accessible regions are tricky to call because of variability in transposition reaction efficiency, among other reasons
# Attention network for predicting T cell receptor-peptide binding can associate attention with interpretable protein structural properties
 - machine learning model based on modified version of Transformer, source-target attention neural network
# Autoantibody profiles in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced neurological immune related adverse events
 - higher prevalence of neuromuscular autoantibodies in irAE patients (63% had autoantibodies vs. 7% in no irAE group)
 - brain-reactive autoantibodies in 45% of irAE patients (20% of controls at baseline, but 7 controls developed *de novo* brain-reactive autoantibodies after ICI so no difference between irAE groups)
# Autoimmune dilated cardiomyopathy in PD-1 receptor-deficient mice
 - PD-1 prevents autoimmunity, here PD-1 KO leads to cardiomyocyte death
 - PD-L1 constitutively expressed in heart and kidney, as well as on APCs, likely that heart cells downregulate proliferation of autoreactive lymphocytes
# Autoimmune panels as predictors of toxicity in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ALERT)
 - auto antigen microarray to profile autoantibodies related to irAEs in patients receiving ICI
 - greater number of IgG and IgM reactivites in pre-ICI in patients vs. healthy controls

## Summary
 - DITAS: discovery of tumor-associated self-antigens to find peptides that induce both antitumor and irAE responses, analyze shared antigens between NSCLC and lung tissue, determine which HLA peptides bind to, predicting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes of peptides
## Abstract
 - DITAS computes transcriptional similarity between lung tumors and healthy lung tissue, identify 10 lung tissue-specific genes highly expressed in lung tumors
 - napsin A: self antigen that elicited strong CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, ICB responders have higher napsin A-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies than non-responders
 - HLA class I ligands from napsin A present in human lung tumors and non-tumor lung tissue
 - napsin A-specific T cell clonotypes enriched in lung tumors and ICB-induced inflammatory lung lesions, able to kill HLA-matched NSCLC cells *ex vivo* and express proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic markers
## Introduction
 - **vitiligo being more common in patients with melanoma treated with ICB is evidence for shared antigens (GP100, MART-1, tyrosinase) underlying irAEs and clinical response, similarly pneumonitis (alveoli wall inflammation) more common in ICB-treated patients with NSCLC than those with melanoma**
## Results
### DITAS: an approach to identify tumor-associated antigens based on tissue similarities
 - melanoma cells resemble melanocytes, NSCLC cells resemble lung tissue by mRNA expression, as expected, then perhaps also similar antigenic profiles
### Validation of napsin A as a lung tumor self-antigen
 - MART-1 and GP100 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses greater in patients with melanoma than in those with NSCLC
 - recognition of specific antigens varied markedly between patients
### Functional relevance of napsin A-specific T cells
 - ICB responders had higher frequencies of napsin A-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after stimulation with napsin A peptide pool compared with nonresponders
## Discussion
 - T cells thought to be major mediators of irAEs (activity enhanced by ICB)
 - theories for breached regulation of T cell activity during ICB: **neoantigen (T cells targeting cancer neoantigens cross-react with WT version of protein in healthy tissue)** and tissue-associated antigen (antigens shared between tumor and healthy tissue) theories
# Autoreactive T cell receptors with shared germline-like α chains in type 1 diabetes
## Abstract
 - identify class of TCRs that share TCR α chains between individuals ("public" chains, scRNAseq)
 - use multiplexed CD154 enrichment to isolate IAR T cells from peripheral blood
 - identify paired TCRαβ sequences from 2,767 cells, more than 1/4 share TCR junctions between 2 or more cells ("expanded"), and ~62% of expanded TCRs show specificity for islet antigen epitopes
 - public TCR sharing TCRα junctions most prominent in new-onset T1D
 - public TCR sequences more germline-like than expanded, unique, "private" TCRs and had shorter junction sequences (fewer random nucleotide insertions)
 - public TCRα junctions most often paired with mismatched TCRβ junctions in TCRs, a subset of these TCRs cross-reactive towards distinct islet antigen peptides
 - takehome: population of IAR T cells with diverse specificities determined by TCRs with restricted TCRα junctions and germline-constrained antigen recognition properties
 - "innate-like" TCRs differ from immunodominant TCRβ chains in autoimmunity
## Introduction
 - human islet antigen reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells (IAR T cells) involved in β cell destruction, perhaps biomark T1D
 - the extreme diversity of TCR sequences allows for private expanded TCR clonotypes, but public expanded TCR sequences are also sometimes observed (perhaps a continuum rather than a binary public/private)
 - shared public sequences prominent in TCRs recognizing microbial antigens, **I wonder why**, and have been implicated in autoimmune disease
## Results
### Expanded IAR T cells recognize multiple islet epitopes
 - recombinant lentiviral transduction to ectopically express TCR sequences in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - **expanded TCRs had multiple specificities**
 - most often TCRs recognized GAD65 peptides, then IGRP, then ZNT8 (there were more GADD65 peptides in the pool though), surprisingly no recognition of preproinsulin epitope
### Expanded public IAR TCRs are more prevalent in new-onset T1D
### Public TCRs are more germline like
 - junction length inversely related to germline-ness (fewer nontemplated nucleotide additions i.e. shorter junction means more germline-like)
## Discussion
 - increased frequency of public TCRs in IAR T cells of new-onset T1D patients relative to established T1D patients, perhaps due to a dilution of specificities as epitope spreading occurs, migration of islet antigen-specific T cells to pancreas, or clone contraction due to antigen loss during islet destruction
 - **would expect more germline-like TCRs to be more cross-reactive (lower sequence complexity)**
 - **cross-reactivity need not result from sequence similarity (3D structural similarity more important than 1D sequence similarity)**

# Benchmarking of T cell receptor repertoire profiling methods reveals large systematic biases
 - methods (RACE vs. mutliplex for example PCR) differ in accuracy and intra/inter-method reproducibility for TRA/TRB sequencing
 - most methods do worse for TRA than TRB
 - low RNA input leads to non-representative TCR repertoires
# Beneficial autoimmunity improves cancer prognosis
 - beneficial autoimmunity referring to irAEs being associated with improved survival on ICIs **as well as spontaneous autoimmunity without ICIs in patients with tumors**
 - importance of non-mutated tumor antigens that are autoantigens, for example from reactivated embryonic/gonadal transcriptional programs, epigenetic changes, aberrant RNA splicing, translation of noncoding RNAs (cryptic peptides), unique PTMs, not unique to tumor cells but enriched on them
# Biomarkers of checkpoint inhibitor induced immune-related adverse events - a comprehensive review
 - blood-based, immunogenetic and microbial biomarkers predicting irAEs prior to and during ICI therapy
 - no single biomarker has proven to be sufficiently predictive for irAE development
 - **CTLA-4 expression on Tregs can lead to trans-endocytosis of CD80/86 ligands (B7-1/2) on APCs, leaving APCs without costimulatory factors**
 - the higher frequency of autoantibody-related irAEs such as thyroid disorders in PD-1 treated patients could be a result of the modulation of humoral immunity by PD-1-inhibitors or of its effects on self-tolerance. 
 - **baseline markers: peripheral blood lymphocyte counts > 2,000, lower % PD-1 expression on T cells, lower % Tregs, lower IL-6/8 levels, higher IL-17 levels, autoantibodies, some HLA alleles, among other things all associated with more irAEs**
 - **on treatment markers: increased leukocyte count, clonal expansion of more T cell clones, more newly emerging T cell clones, decline in T cell clonality, increased IL-6 levels, among other things all associated with more irAEs**
 - **takehome for me: on treatment markers including clonal expansion of more T cell clones, more newly emerging T cell clones, decline in T cell clonality all very interestingly associated with more irAEs**
# Biomarkers on melanoma patient T cells associated with ipilimumab treatment

 - **decreased Ki67 CD8s associated with irAE, this is unlike most other proliferation literature I've read...**
# Biomarkers for immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated tumor response and adverse events

# CD28/PD1 co-expression: dual impact on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood and tumor tissue, and its significance in NSCLC patients' survival and ICB response
## Background
 - exhaustion is now recognized to have a dynamic progression from a long-lived "pre-exhausted stem-like progenitor" (more responsive likely to re-invigoration by ICB) to a "terminally exhausted" state
 - **CD28 is a prerequisite for optimal T cell re-invigoration following PD1 blockade, CD28 primary target downstream of PD1-mediated inhibitory signaling**
 - **main finding: signatures of heterogeneous tumor infiltrating TRM and “pre-exhausted” long-lived effector-memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were associated with better ICB response only in the presence of CD28**
# CD103<sup>+</sup> tumor-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are associated with improved survival in immunotherapy-naive melanoma patients and expand significantly during anti-PD-1 treatment

## Highlights and summary
 - adding CTLA-4 blockade to PD-L1 blockade promotes CD4 T expansion
 - pre-existing T1 immunity predicts expansion upon combination ICB
 - head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients
 - single cell profiling of on- versus pre-treatment samples
 - PD-L1 blockade triggers CD8 T expansion, combination ICB triggers expansion of CD4s (Th1 phenotype) and CD8s
 - CTLA-4 blockade, not PD-L1 blockade, induces trafficking of CD4 naive/CM from tumor-draining lymph nodes via blood to tumor
## Discussion
 - intratumoral T cell expansion correlates with tumor shrinkage after 1 cycle of ICB (surrogate for early response to ICB)
 - **perhaps since CTLA-4 blockade is associated with more irAEs, it's the CD4 T expansion that's important for irAEs**
# CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are essential for the development of destructive thyroiditis induced by anti-PD-1 antibody in thyroglobulin-immunized mice
## Abstract
 - PD-1 blockade in thyroglobulin-immunized mice induces destructive thyroiditis, prevented by previous depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and partially prevented by previous depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets (central and effector memory) frequencies and interferon γ production after stimulation with thyroglobulin increased in lymph nodes of mice with thyroid irAE over controls
 - infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing granzyme B in thyroid glands and MHC class II expression on thyrocytes in mice with thyroid irAE
 - adoptive transfer of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from lymph nodes in mice with thyroid irAE destroys thryoid follicular architecture in irradiated recipient mice
 - frequencies of central and effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD27 (CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxic marker) higher in PBMCs from human patients with thyroid irAE induced by PD-1 blockade than those without (also higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies in general), similar CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies
## Discussion
 - mouse destructive thyroiditis only induced by PD-1 blockade with prior immunization with thyroglobulin, so there's an involvement of activated memory cells specific for thyroglobulin in irAEs (memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induced by previous immunization with thyroglobulin activated by PD-1 blockade and cause irAE)
 - CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can show cytotoxic characteristics in some chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer
# CD49a expression defines tissue-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells poised for cytotoxic function in human skin
 - cytotoxic function including IFN-γ production, driven by IL-15
 - CD49a<sup>-</sup> CD8 Trms produce IL-17
# CD4 T cells and toxicity from immune checkpoint blockade
 - review of a paper I've read

# CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte infiltration is a specific feature of colitis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - histological infiltration comparisons between irAE colitis and non-irAE colitis (like ulcerative colitis, ischemic colitis)
 - **irAE colitis: CD8<sup>+</sup> infiltration greater than CD4<sup>+</sup> infiltration**
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> infiltration higher in irAE colitis than in non-irAE colitis
# CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the cancer-immunity cycle
## Introduction
 - 3 signal model for effective T cell priming and differentiation: 1) TCR signaling by antigens presented by MHCs, 2) co-stimulation, 3) cytokines, all 3 signals necessary to effectively prime naive T cells and differentiate them into effector T cells, perhaps a fourth signal being nutrients/metabolites fueling T cell metabolism
## CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation states
 - with optimal signals (vaccinations, acutely resolving infections), naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into effector T cells (T<sub>eff</sub> cells) or memory precursors, then into long-lived memory T cells once the antigen is cleared
 - memory T cell population is heterogeneous: stem cell memory (Tscm), central memory (Tcm), effector memory (Tem), effector memory re-expressing CD45RA (Temra), tissue resident memory (Trm)
 - persistent stimulation (especially via TCR) leads to exhaustion (epigenetically coordinated by transcription factor TOX)
 - exhausted T cells characterized by high co-expression of multiple inhibitory receptors (PD-1, CD39, LAG-3) and reduced proportion of effector cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF, IL-2)
 - exhausted T cells are not non-functional but rather have altered effector function (adapted to withstand chronic antigen stimulation), maintain moderate control while avoiding excessive immunopathology
 - **inflection point of irreversible exhaustion seems to be 2-3 weeks of chronic antigen stimulation, major epigenetic and transcriptional changes**
## Signals
### Signal 1: TCR signaling and antigens
 - tumor-associated antigens (differentiation, overexpressed, cancer germ line or testis antigens, ERV-derived antigens), T cells targeting these may express TCRs with low affinity (autoreactive)
 - tumor-specific antigens (~foreign antigens, neoantigens or viral proteins in the cases of oncogenic viruses), T cells specific to tumor-specific antigens aren't subject to central tolerance
 - most neoantigens are patient specific, requiring individualized treatment (perhaps mRNA vaccines?)
 - immune editing: on-target T cell responses can lead to the elimination of tumor subpopulations expressing immunogenic antigens, resulting in eventual tumor escape as resistant tumor subpopulations are selected for
### Signal 2: Co-stimulation and co-inhibition
 - co-stimulation from CD80/86 ligands on APC (upregulated in infections) received via CD28 receptor on T cell, leading to full activation of the T cell (survival, metabolism, cytokine production)
 - other co-stimulatory molecules: CD40L, OX40, 4-1BB, **ICOS**, CD27, involved in priming/later stages of T cell differentiation
 - following activation, T cells increase CTLA-4 expression (outcompetes CD28 for CD80/86 and regulates extent and duration of T cell activation to prevent excessive immunopathology), other negative signals include PD-1, LAG-3, 2B4, TIGIT, TIM-3
### Signal 3: Cytokines
 - IL-12, type I IFN, also IL-1/6/10/18/27/33 and TGFβ, among others
# CD8 T cell function and crossreactivity explored by stepwise increased peptide-HLA versus TCR affinity
 - vaccines with native tumor epitope (vs. HLA affinity-optimized epitope) generated T cells eith better functionality and enhanced crossreactivity against potential low affinity escape epitopes
 - cumulative impact of peptide:HLA and TCR-peptide:HLA affinity on T cell responses
# CDR3 length in antigen-specific immune receptors
 - TCR α and β chain distributions are highly constrained, with nearly identical average CDR3 lengths, and their length distributions are not altered by thymic selection
 - CDR3 length distributions do not correlate with genetic variability of the CDR3 region; the most constrained CDR3 length distributions are those of the α and β chains, yet they are highly variable genetically
# CDR3 sequences in IgA nephropathy are shorter and exhibit reduced diversity
 - B cells
# Cellular alterations in immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy-related cardiac dysfunction
 - perhaps underlying conditions aggrevated from ICB to induce cardiac irAE
# Changes of peripheral T cell subsets in melanoma patients with immune-related adverse events
## T cell changes in patients with severe irAEs receiving anti-PD-1 monotherapy
 - no clear differences
## Changes in T cell subsets in patients with severe irAEs receiving dual immune checkpoint blockade
 - **decreased frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and increased frequency of CD56<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells before and after the start of the treatment**
 - **increased frequency of EMRA CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells seen before and after start of dual ICB**
 - **increase in Ki67<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells after starting the treatment in patients experiencing severe irAE**
# Characterization of antibody repertoires in patients with HPV-related HNSCC undergoing definitive radiation with immunotherapy
 - HNSCC: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
 - in patients with p16-positive HNSCC, see many antigens against which antibodies were formed during radiation therapy and ICI shared between patients
# Characterization of anti-cancer immune response associated with immune-related adverse events in patients with kidney cancer
 - more irAEs in ICB responders, not a new finding
 - less diverse repertoires in irAE patients 1 month after ICB (expansion of certain T cell clones in PBMCs)
 - **irAE patients had more peripheral T cell clones shared with TILs**
 - **some irAE-provoked T cell clones circulate systemically and attack tumor cells leading to ICB response in irAE patients or vice a versa some tumor-provoked T cell clones circulate systemically and attack self leading to irAEs? not sure how they differentiate between the two**
# Characterization of nivolumab-associated skin reactions in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
 - skin irAEs correlated with tumor responses in most responders and barely any non-responders
# Characterization of Thyroid Disorders in Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibition Therapy
 - thyroid disorders are a common irAE following ICI
# Checkpoint blockade cancer immunotherapy targets tumor-specific mutant antigens
# Checkpoint blockade-induced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation in head and neck cancer responders
 - ICB response in recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamos cell carcinoma (HNSCC) limited to 15-20% of patients
 - mice
# Checkpoint blockade-induced dermatitis and colitis are dominated by tissue-resident memory T cells and Th1/Tc1 cytokines
 - CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells preferentially expanded in inflammed portion of skin in cutaneous irAEs
# Checkpoint-blocker-induced autoimmunity is associated with favorable outcome in metastatic melanoma and distinct T cell expression profiles
## Abstract
 - pre-treatment monocyte and neutrophil counts also predicted clinical outcome (negatively prognostic)
 - DEGs in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by irAE development, patients not developing irAEs had upregulated *CXCR1* pre/post-treatment
## Background
 - it's not consistently observed but sometimes observed that there's an association between irAE development and improved treatment response (suggesting a link between reduced tolerance to self-antigens and tumor antigens)
## Results
### Association of irAE development with divergent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell gene expression
 - peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expression profiles have been linked with clinical outcome
 - **gene pathways including chemokine-mediated signaling, extracellular matrix organisation, and platelet degranulation altered in irAE development**
### *CXCR1* and irAE
 - increased *CXCR1* expression (and *CXCR2* but less so) associated with reduced irAE development
 - *CXCR1/2* encode chemokine receptors for IL-8
 - IL-8 levels a negative prognostic
## Discussion
 - sex is more likely to be associated with autoimmune incidence than irAE development, so classical risk factors for autoimmunity may be less relevant for irAEs, **back to Peter's point of not treating them the same**
 - different irAEs occur at different times (cutaneous ones, colitis, hepatitis early, gastritis and pneumonitis late), suggesting divergent pathophysiology
 - **they say steroids and other immunosuppressants used to manage irAEs are unlikely to affect prognosis, which surprises me as I thought they could interfere with the anti-tumor activities of ICB**
 - **see baseline changes in single ICB recipients who proceeded to develop irAE with enrichment in complement activity, innate immunity and neutrophil degranulation pathways**
# Chimeric CTLA-4-CD28-CD3z T cells potentiate antitumor activity against CD80/CD86-positive B cell malignancies
 - overcome inhibitive microenvironment of tumor by making chimeric CTLA-4 (extracellular and transmembrane domains) CD28/CD3z (cytoplasmic domains) protein, so off signal becomes on signal
 - CTLA-4 upregulated after T cell activation, to prevent too much activation?
 - CD80/86 are CTLA-4 ligands
 - CAR T cells (chimeric antigen receptor T cells): extracellular ligand recognition domain (single chain variable fragment, ScFv) fused to signaling domain of CD3z, intracellular costimulatory molecule (CD28, 4-1BB, ICOS, CD40, or CD27)
# Chromatin accessibility profiling by ATAC-seq
 - success of ATAC-seq library generation determined by enrichment of transposase insertions in accessible chromatin (signal:background, **most important QC metric, can test with TSS enrichment score as TSSs known to be accessible**), unique fragments number (library complexity), ratio of reads mapping to nuclear genome versus those mapping to mitochondrial genome (undesired), and fragment size distribution
# Circulating pre-treatment T cell repertoire as a predictive biomarker in advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with pembrolizumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy
 - association between reduced number of unique clones and clinical benefit for pembrolizumab, but for pembrolizumab with chemotherapy see opposite effect
 - reduced number of pre-treatment unique clones could mean enrichment for tumor-specific T cells (good response to treatment)
# Clinical characteristics and treatment of immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors
## Mechanisms of irAEs
 - hypotheses: ICI usage breaks up homeostasis and reduces T cell tolerance, cross-reactivity of T cells between tumor cells and normal tissue, ICI usage can increase pre-existing autoantibody levels as well as inflammatory cytokine levels, ICI can disturb CTLA-4/PD-L1 blocks in tissue expressing those inhibitory receptors to protect normal tissue
# Clinical drug screening reveals clofazimime potentiates the efficacy while reducing the toxicity of anti-PD-1 and CTLA-4 immunotherapy
 - clofazimine promotes E2F1-TCF1 activation in CD8s to overcome ICB resistance and promote anti-tumor effect, counteracts pathogenic Th17s to reduce irAEs
# Clinical outcome following checkpoint therapy in renal cell carcinoma is associated with a burst of activated CD8 T cells in blood
## Abstract
 - small proportion of CD4 and CD8 T cells in blood activate following ICB (express Ki67 and cell cycle genes, activation markers HLA-DR, CD38, also effector molecules like granzymes, CXCR3)
 - patients with highest increase in HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells after treatment had best antitumor responses and clinical benefit
 - these cells expanded in most patients but phenotype didn't change much during treatment, but **only patients with clinical benefit had burst of new clonotypes enter HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell pool of activated cells**
## Introduction
 - new CD8 clonotypes enter blood after ICB and this increase in clonotypes is associated with better survival, so these are newly activated or reactivated (dormant?) clones
 - CD8 T cell infiltration into tumor also associated with better survival
## Discussion
 - phenotype of effector seems less important than number and repertoire of T cells responding to treatment
 - patients with more CD8 T cells in tumor exhibit better survival, better infiltration also not surprising here to help out
 - hypothesis for **model: pool of tumor-specific TCF-1<sup>+</sup> stem-like CD8 T cells that aren't proliferating or generating antitumor effector cells that are a reservoir unleashed by ICB, seen by large burst of HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup+</sup> CD8 T cells after ICB and new repertoire**
# Clonal dynamics of alloreactive T cells in kidney allograft rejection after anti-PD-1 therapy
 - alloreactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells clonally expanded after ICI, acquired distinctive transcriptomic signature, accumulated in transplanted kidney during ICB-mediated allograft rejection
 - despite 10 years of stable allograft function, alloreactive T cells remained present in kidney transplant recipient (unleashed by ICB), so didn't see clonal deletion
# Clonal exhaustion as a mechanism to protect against severe immunopathology and death from an overwhelming CD8 T cell response
 - possible evolutionary reason for T cell exhaustion
# Clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in the systemic circulation precedes development of ipilimumab-induced toxicities
## Significance
 - CD8 T cell clonal expansion within systemic circulation potential correlative biomarker of irAEs in prostate cancer patients receiving ICI
## Abstract
 - 27 metastatic prostate cancer patients
 - sequencing of TCRβ chains revealed clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in blood samples collected before irAE onset
 - expansion of > 55 CD8 T cell clones preceeded severe irAE onset
## Introduction
 - **hypothesis: clonal expansion of T cells in systemic circulation, which could be reactive against self-antigens, may correlate with irAEs (analogous to clonal expansion of T cells in tumor tissues, which are likely tumor reactive, perhaps predicting clinical benefit with immune checkpoint therapy)**
## Results
### Evaluation for biomarkers that may correlate with clinical outcomes
 - increased ICOS<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells biomarker of ICI
 - clinically benefitting patients more likely to have higher levels of CD3 T cells expressing CTLA-4 in pre-treatment blood
 - also see better clinical response from patients with increased baseline CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> CD3 T cell to PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD3 T cell ratio, perhaps due to here using CTLA-4 blockade?
 - pre-/on-treatment T cell clonality didn't correlate with clinical outcomes but **CD8 T cell clonal expansion was greater in patients developing severe irAEs**
### Circulating CD8 T cell clonal expansion precedes the development of grade 2-3
## Discussion
 - previous literature has suggested increased T cell clonality in tumor microenvironment correlates with clinical response to PD-1 blockade
 - **most irAEs are similar irregardless of tumor/blockade type, so perhaps there's a common mechanism underlying irAEs**
 - immunosuppressive therapies can be used to treat irAEs, shorter course required if used sooner (but early irAE manifestations can be subtle)
# Clonal expansion of resident memory T cells in peripheral blood of patients with non-small cell lung cancer durine immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment
 - among T cell subtypes, effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> TEM GZMK PDCD1) were increased after ICI treatment in both DCB and NCB
 - effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells resided at the bifurcation point, which has the potential to differentiate into lineages with precursor exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> TCM cells) assumed to be related to the ICI response
 - effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells along with T cells recognizing unknown antigen expanded and composed of novel clones skewed toward dysfunctional status, especially in on-treatment samples of the durable clinical benefit group
# Clonality of CD4<sup>+</sup> blood T cells predicts longer survival with CTLA-4 or PD-1 checkpoint inhibition in advanced melanoma
 - greater diversity of CD4<sup>+</sup> blood T cell clones before ICB correlated with long-term survival with ICB
 - irAE patients had T cell repertoires restricted during CTLA-4 blockade, so newly expanded oligoclonal T cell responses may contribute to irAEs
# Clonally-expanded, thyrotoxic effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells driven by *IL-21* contribute to checkpoint inhibitor thyroiditis
## Abstract
 - clonally expanded population of thyroid-infiltrating cytotoxic CXCR6<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> (effector) T cells in ICI-thyroiditis but not Hashimoto/HC
 - IL-21 drives these thyrotoxic effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (upregulated cytotoxic molecules), IL-21 secreted by intrathyroidal T follicular and T peripheral helper cells
## Results
 - thyroid-infiltrating immune cells in ICI-thyroiditis and HT (autoimmune) mostly CD4 and CD8 T cells, IL-21<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> Tfh and Tph cells specifically for CD4s, **more CD8s in ICI-thyroiditis than HT**
# Clonal replacement of tumor-specific T cells following PD-1 blockade
## Abstract
 - unclear if ICB relies/works on reinvigoration of pre-existing tumor infiltrating T cells or on recruitment of novel T cells
 - clonally-expanded cells were highly enriched in exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and expressed markers of tumor specificity, including CD39 and CD103
 - expansion didn't derive from pre-existing TIL clones but rather from novel clonotypes not previously observed in the same tumor (clonal replacement)
 - pre-existing tumor-specific T cells may have limited reinvigoration capacity due to chronic activation/exhaustion (epigenetic remodeling); the T cell response to checkpoint blockade derives from a distinct repertoire of T cell clones that may have just recently entered the tumor
 - **novel T cell clones could derive from lymphoid organs or rare unexpanded clones within TME/tumor periphery that weren't exhausted**
# Colon immune-related adverse events: anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 blockade induce distinct immunopathological entities
 - **PD-1 blockade colitis seems more CD8 T, CTLA-4 blockade colitis seems more CD4 T (lamina propria)**
 - no differences in mucosal Tregs between ICB drugs and IBD
 - higher numbers of activated ICOS<sup>+</sup> CD4 Ts in CTLA-4 blockade colitis vs. IBD
# Comparative analyses of CDR3 regions in paired human αβ CD8 T cells
 - CDR3 length among paired αβ TCRs had a fairly narrow distribution due to random assortment of CDR3 length in alpha and beta chains
 - nucleotide deletions among CDR3 regions were positively correlated with insertions in both α and β TCRs
 - CDR3 loops of both α and β chains contained an abundance of charged/polar residues and the CDR3 base regions contained a conserved motif
 - the occurrence of Gly was CDR3 length‐ and position‐dependent in both chains, whereas the frequency of Ser at positions 106 and 107 was positively correlated with CDR3 length in TCR β
 - the amino acids in CDR3 loop regions were significantly different between TCR α and β, which suggests a distinct role for each chain in the recognition of antigen–MHC complexes
 - **see length-dependent increase in glycine usage, may confer cross-reactivity with glycine's small size**
# Comparative immunologic characterization of autoimmune giant cell myocarditis with ipilimumab
 - see more sharing between myocarditis tissue TCRs and lung tumor TCRs (~10%) vs. hepatitis tissue TCRs and myocarditis tissue TCRs (~1%)
 - see more T cells in myocarditis tissue (mostly CD4<sup>+</sup>) than hepatitis tissue
 - perhaps related to hepatiits being steroid responsive, myocarditis being steroid refractory
# Comparing anti-tumor and anti-self immunity in a patient with melanoma receiving immune checkpoint blockade
 - irAE tissues overexpressed immunosuppression genes (*CSF1R*, *IL10RA*, *IL27/EBI3*, *FOXP3*, *KLRG1*, *SOCS1*, *TGFB1*, *IL1B*, *PTGER1/EP1*, *PTGER4/EP4*), **not sure of mechanism here besides potentially more Tregs as I've seen elsewhere higher Tregs in irAE (which I don't have a good hypothesis for really)**, may have implications for ICB resistance
 - **TCRseq didn't find common TCR repertoires between tumor and irAE sites, arguing against shared antigen recognition between tumor and self, although they may have just not detected rare/small subset of overlapping TCRs; their figure on this was a little confusing to me as they did clustering of TCR repertoires across sites vs. just counting % shared TCRs between sites or something more intuitive**
# Complete and early response to cemiplimab associated to severe immune toxicity in advanced cervical cancer: a case report
 - potential supplementary evidence for irAE association with ICB response
# Complimentary mechanisms of dual checkpoint blockade expand unique T cell repertoires and activate adaptive anti-tumor immunity in triple-negative breast tumors
 - efficacy of dual ICB (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1) in TNBC derives from CTLA-4 blockade-driven expansion of T cells whose functionality is enhanced by PD-1 blockade
# Comprehensive multiplexed autoantibody profiling of patients with advanced urothelial cancer
 - autoantibodies against MITF, CDH3, KDM4A associated with irAE development
# Computational simulations of bispecific T-cell engagers by a multiscale model
 - modeling to try and understand mechanism of bispecific antibodies as T cell engagers (bypass TCR-pMHC interaction, redirect cytotoxic activity, can help kill cancer cells but also off target effects)
# Consensus disease definitions for neurologic immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - neurologic irAE indicence rate: 1-12%
 - CNS (meningitis, encephalitis, demyelinating syndrome, vasculitis) and PNS (neuropathy, NMJ disorders, myopathy)
# Contribution of the skin-gut axis to immune-related adverse events with multi-system involvement
 - skin irAEs may predict other irAEs
# Co-regulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion by multiple inhibitory receptors during chronic viral infection
 - co-expression of multiple distinct inhibitory receptors associated with greater T cell exhaustion and more severe infection (in context of chronic infection causing T cell exhaustion)
 - blockade of T cell inhibitory receptors PD-1, LAG-3 reinvigorate T cells
# Correlation between vitiligo occurrence and clinical benefit in advanced melanoma patients treated with nivolumab: A multi-institutional retrospective study
 - occasionally see vitiligo in melanoma patients
 - some propose correlation between vitiligo occurrence and clinical response in melanoma patients receiving immunotherapy, but most studies have included heterogeneous patient and treatment settings
 - goal: investigate correlation between vitiligo occurrence and clinical benefit of immunotherapy
 - results: vitiligo occurrence correlated with favorable clinical outcome
# CrossDome: an interactive R package to predict cross-reactivity risk using immunopeptidomics databases
 - both peptide- and TCR-centered predictions
 - **more focused on peptide-based vaccines or adoptive T cell therapy rather than ICB, perhaps still useful though for me**
 - alanine/X scans can provide an initial assessment of T cell crossreactivity potential (guides proteomic searches for similar peptide motifs)
# Crossreactivity of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A-specific T cells in individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2
## Abstract
 - geographical association between high influenza vaccination rates and lower incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infection (crossreactive T cells)
 - heterologous immunity
 - use artificial APCs and RT-qPCR to screen for antigen-specific T cell responses, see correlation between responses to SARS-CoV-2 epitope and IAV dominant epitope
 - TCR repertoires of crossreactive and IAV-specific T cells reveals similarities
## Discussion
 - **heterologous immunity may be beneficial in short run (crossreactive memory T cells primed to quickly respond to new antigen) but may be detrimental in long run (narrows TCR diversity, promotes development of viral escape variants)**
# CTLA-4 antibody-drug conjugte reveals autologous destruction of B lymphocytes associated with regulatory T cell impairment
 - cancer patients with irAEs have reduced peripheral B cells, unknown why
 - mice
 - ICI mice have T cell hyperproliferation, differentiation into effector cells, which depletes B cells (**not sure why that is**)
# CTLA-4 blockade enhances polyfunctional NY-ESO-1 specific T cell responses in metastatic melanoma patients with clinical benefit
 - 5/8 of patients with clinical benefit to CTLA-4 blockade had NY-ESO-1 antibody (and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against NY-ESO-1), 0/7 of clinical non-responders had NY-ESO-1 antibody
 - NY-ESO-1 is a cancer antigen
 - T cell responses were polyfunctional (IFN-γ, MIP-1β, TNF-α)
 - all 8 patients with clinical benefit had at least 1 irAE, but 87% of all patients had at least one irAE, so it doesn't seem like there was a huge difference in irAE incidence between those with clinical benefit and those without
# CTLA-4 blockade increases Th17 cells in patients with metastatic melanoma
 - **Th17 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells produce IL-17, potent inducers of tissue inflammation and autoimmunity, connection to irAEs likely?**
 - activated PBMCs (*in vitro*) show higher IL-17 production post CTLA-4 blockade
# Cutaneous manifestations associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - proposed mechanisms: activation of T cells against common antigens in normal tissues and tumor cells (evidenced by association between vitiligo and melanoma for example), increased release of proinflammatory cytokines (ICB enhances Th1/17), association with specific HLA variants (mechanism unclear, seems irAE organ specific)
# Current best practices in single cell RNA-seq analysis: a tutorial
## Data production
 - single cell suspension generated by dissociating tissue
 - isolate single cells: plate-based (single cells into wells) or droplet based (single cells into droplets), both methods can lead to multiple cells being captured together, no cells being captured (empty wells/droplets), or non-viable cells being captured
 - each well/droplet contains chemicals to break open cells and construct libraries (mRNA reverse transcribed to cDNA, amplified, well/droplet-specific barcodes, also often label molecules with UMI), amplify before sequencing to increase probability of capturing molecules, UMIs allow distinguishing between amplified copies of the same mRNA molecule (don't count separately) and reads from separate mRNA molecules transcribed from the same gene (do count separately)
 - after constructing libraries, cellular cDNA libraries are labelled with cellular barcodes, sometimes UMIs too
 - then pool libraries together (multiplexing) for sequencing to produce read data
## Raw data processing
 - group raw data based on barcodes (demultiplexing), align reads, demultiplex based on UMIs to take read data into count data (counts of captured mRNAs), called count matrices/molecular counts if UMIs were used and read counts/read matrices if UMIs weren't used
 - demultiplex, align to genome, quantify
 - dimensions of data are number of barcodes (ideally meaning cell but not always the case as when a barcode may mistakenly tag multiple different cells i.e. in a doublet/multiplet or may not tag any cells at all in the case of empty wells/droplets) by number of transcripts
## Quality control
 - ensure that all barcode data correspond to viable cells
 - perform QC on count depth (number of counts per barcode), number of genes per barcode, and fraction of counts from mitochondrial genes per barcode
 - outliers can correspond to dying cells, cells with broken cell membranes (but perhaps intact mitochondrial membranes leaving few counts and detected genes but a high mitochondrial count fraction), doublets/multiplets
 - high mitochondrial count fraction could also just mean that the cell is very active in cellular respiration though
 - low counts/genes could also just mean quiescent cells
 - high counts/genes could also just mean large cells
# CXCR5<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells: potential immunotherapy targets or drivers of immune-mediated adverse events?
 - CXCR5<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells are cytotoxic but also associate with B cells to effect their function (so these CD8s are similar to CD4 Tfhs)
 - tumors express CXCR5 and produce its ligand CXCL13 to recruit B/T cells into TME (**not sure of advantage of tumor doing this**)
# Cysteine and hydrophobic residues in CDR3 serve as distinct T cell self-reactivity indices
 - rare thymocytes survive strong self-antigen enagement and differentiate into type A precursors of CD8αα<sup>+</sup> intestinal interepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) or CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs in thymic medulla
 - Tregs enriched with hydrophobic amino acids at positions 6 and 7 of CDR3 in TCRβ chain
# Cytomegalovirus in autoimmunity: T cell crossreactivity to viral antigen and autoantigen glutamic acid decarboxylase
## Abstract
 - foreign antigens that mimic autoantigens can trigger autoimmunity, for example viral infections associated with T1D development
 - GAD65 is a major autoantigen of T1D and stiff-man syndrome
 - screen synthetic peptide libraries dedicated to bind to HLA-DR3, which predisposes people to T1D and stiff-man syndrome, using clonal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells reactive to GAD65 isolated from prediabetic stiff-man syndrome patient
 - result: GAD65-specific T cells crossreact with peptide of hCMV major DNA binding protein, hCMV-derived epitope can be processed by DCs and recognized by GAD65-reactive T cells
 - **takehome: hCMV may be involved in loss of T cell tolerance to autoantigen GAD65 by a mechanism of molecular mimicry leading to autoimmunity, perhaps analogous to loss of tolerance to autoantigens by mechanism of molecular mimicry between tumor antigen and self antigen leading to irAEs**
## Introduction
 - GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase) neuroenzyme expressed in neurons and β cells
## Discussion
 - clonal T cells recognizing GAD65 339-352 crossreact with hCMV major DNA-binding protein pUL57 peptide 674-687, peptide efficiently processed for presentation by HLA-DR3
 - crossreactive response may be polyclonal, so T cells recognizing hCMV peptide more efficiently than GAD65 peptide may exist
# Deciphering pathogenic cellular module at single-cell resolution in checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis
 - single cell RNAseq of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
 - also do TCR analysis!
 - CXCL13<sup>+</sup> T cells and hyperinflammatory CXCL9<sup>+</sup> monocytes accumulate in pneumonitis patient samples
# Deconstructing the peptide-MHC specificity of T cell recognition
 - identify MHC-presented peptide ligands by combining TCR selection of highly diverse yeast-displayed peptide-MHC libraries with deep sequencing
 - structural conservation of the TCR interaction surface, not surprising
 - alloreactivity: ability of TCR to bind multiple MHCs
# Defining CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that provide the proliferative burst after PD-1 therapy
 - virus-specific CD8s (ICOS<sup>+</sup> CD28<sup>+</sup>) proliferate after PD-1 blockade in mice chronically infected with LCMV
# Defining the memory CD8 T cell
 - effector (T<sub>em</sub>, CD62L<sup>low</sup>CCR7<sup>low</sup>) and central (T<sub>cm</sub>, CD62L<sup>high</sup>CCR7<sup>high</sup>) memory T cells
 - CCR7/CD62L expression on T<sub>cm</sub> cells facilitates homing to secondary lymph organs, while T<sub>em</sub> cells are more cytolytic and express integrins and chemokine receptors to localize to inflamed tissue
 - tissue resident memory (T<sub>rm</sub>) T cells: permanent residents in tissue (rather than circulating like T<sub>em</sub> cells), integrins CD103/CD49a help enter tissue, CD69 helps with tissue retention
# Deletion of *SNX9* alleviates CD8 T cell exhaustion for effective cellular cancer immunotherapy
# Deletion of the inhibitory co-receptor CTLA-4 enhances and invigorates chimeric antigen receptor T cells
 - deletion of *CTLA4* permits unopposed CD28 signaling in CAR T cells
 - PD-1 deficiency nullifies CD28 signaling enabled by *CTLA4* deletion in CAR T cells
# Depletion of exhausted alloreactive T cells enables targeting of stem-like memory T cells to generate tumor-specific immunity
 - alloreactivity refers to ability of T cells to recognize peptide-allogenic-MHC complexes not encountered during thymic development (HLA/MHC-mismatch recognition, manifestation of transplant rejection and graft-versus-host disease)
 - find that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion in bone marrow was primarily alloantigen-driven
# Detection of identical T cell clones in peritumoral pleural effusion and pneumonitis lesions in a cancer patient during immune-checkpoint blockade

# Determinants of anti-PD-1 response and resistance in clear cell renal cell carcinoma
## Abstract
 - higher number of expanded TCR clones in pre-treatment responders suggesting pre-existing immunity, **presumably to tumor before ICI is what this means?**, maintenance of these pre-treatment expanded clones associates with response
## Introduction
 - clear cell renal cell carcinoma: most common subtype of kidney cancer, immunogenic, most tumor mutational burden (comparable to "cold" tumors, 10-fold lower than melanoma, TMB doesn't associate with ICB response)
# Development of TCRB CDR3 length repertoire of human T lymphocytes
 - previous literature: CDR3s of CD4 thymocytes become shorter during thymic development, i.e. thymocytes with longer CDR3s are more likely to be deleted
 -repertoire distribution patterns depend on use of the BV gene; BV‐dependent patterns were shaped during thymic selections and maintained in the peripheral blood
# Different associations between organ-specific immune-related adverse event and survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with programmed death-1 inhibitors-based combination therapy
 - NSCLC PD-1 blockade plus chemotherapy patients have longer progression free survival (but not necessarily overall survival) with irAEs
 - skin irAE associated with better prognosis, pneumonitis severe irAE and high steroid compromise survival
# Differential requirements for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the efficacy of the anti-PD-1<sup>+</sup> LAG-3 and anti-PD-1<sup>+</sup> CTLA-4 combinations in melanoma flank and brain metastases models
 - mouse melanoma models
 - anti-PD-1<sup>+</sup> CTLA-4 associated with FOXP3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Tregs) infiltrating, fewer activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, accumulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells secreting IFNγ
 - anti-PD-1<sup>+</sup> LAG-3 associated with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CXCF4, TNFSF8, IL21R accumulating
# Differentiation and homeostasis of effector Treg cells are regulated by inositol polyphosphates modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx
 - subclass of Tregs express Foxp3, activated Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs differentiate into effector Treg (eTreg) cells to maintain peripheral immune homeostasis and tolerance
# Digital spatial profiling of melanoma shows CD95 expression in immune cells is associated with resistance to immunotherapy
# Dissecting the tumor microenvironment in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors via single cell and spatial transcriptomics
 - good summary of cancer immunity cycle for me: cancer cells generate neoantigens, present on MHC, APCs sample antigens and present fragments via MHCI/II, APCs traffic to lymph nodes (due to signals from proinflammatory cytokines) and induce expansion and differentiation of naive T cells into cytotoxic effector T cells that migrate to tumor, recognize cancer cells via TCR-pMHCI docking, kill cancer cells, release more neoantigens
 - programs that promote response/resistance to immunotherapy: cell cycle genes (CDK4/6) repress resistance to ICB and sensitize tumors (in mice), TCF7 (transcription factor involved in T cell differentiation) levels higher in responders
# Distinct biomarker profiles and TCR sequence diversity characterize the response to PD-L1 blockade in a mouse melanoma model
 - melanoma tumors arising from a genetically engineered mouse model
 - CD8 T cell tumor infiltration corresponds to response
 - response requires expansion of T cells but also infiltration of T cells into tumor
# Distinct cellular mechanisms underlie anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade
 - goal: elucidate mechanism by which ICI (immune checkpoint inhibitors) induce tumor rejection
 - mass cytometry approach to profile effects of ICI on tumor immune infiltrates in human melanoma and murine tumor models
 - results: ICI targets subsets of tumor infiltrating T cells
 - **PD-1 blockade predominantly induces expansion of specific tumor infiltrating exhausted-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets**
 - **CTLA-4 blockade induces expansion of ICOS<sup>+</sup> Th1-like CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells, also engages specific subsets of exhausted-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells**
 - **different ICI target different T cell subsets**
# Distinct immune-effector and metabolic profile of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in patients with autoimmune polyarthritis induced by therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - **CD8s from irAE patients show lower activation, effector function, homing, exhaustion, apoptosis, reduced release of cytotoxic and proinflammatory immune mediators**
 - **higher glycolytic rate and ATP production from irAE CD8s**
 - metabolic remodeling from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis is hallmark of CD8 activation
# Distinct immune signatures indicative of treatment response and immune-related adverse events in melanoma patients under immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy
 - flow cytometric analyses of 15 patients with stage IV melanoma
 - responders characterized by enhanced PD-1 expression on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells immediately before treatment
 - responders showed a higher T cell responsiveness after T cell receptor ex vivo stimulation as determined by measurement of programmed cell death 1 expression on CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells before the second cycle of treatment
 - percentage of CD8<sup>+</sup> effector memory (CD8<sup>+</sup> CD45RA<sup>-</sup> CD45RO<sup>+</sup> CCR7<sup>-</sup>) T cells was higher in responders compared to non-responders before and immediately after the first cycle of treatment
 - irAEs were accompanied by a higher percentage of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup> HLADR<sup>+</sup>) T cells before the second treatment cycle
# Distinct mechanisms of mismatch repair deficiency delineate two modes of response to PD-1 immunotherpy in endometrial carcinoma
## Abstract
 - mismatch repair-deficient cancers have varied responses to immune checkpoint blockade
 - patients with mutational mismatch repair-deficient endometrial cancers (higher mutational burden) here had higher response rates, longer survival rates than those with epigenetic mismatch repair-deficient tumors, but mutational burden not correlated with ICB response within each category
 - longitudinal scRNAseq: CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells correlated with regression of mutational mismatch repair-deficient tumors, activated CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells associated with ICB-responsive epigenetic mismatch repair-deficient tumors
## Introduction
 - mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) cancers have high mutational loads, especially at repetitive microsatellite regions prone to replication errors (microsatellite instability-high, MSI-H)
 - high mutational burden thought to make many tumor neoantigens that immune system can target
 - however, even among MSI-H/mismatch repair-deficient tumors, ICB response rate varies within and across cancer types (for example 44, 57, 18, 0% responses in colorectal, endometrial, pancreatic, brain cancers respectively)
 - > 70% of MSI-H/MMRd endometrial cancer cases have epigenetic rather than mutational "silencing" (of MLH1 gene promoter, DNA methylation), i.e. epigenetic rather than mutational MMRd
 - here, they classify patients into mutational or epigenetic MMRd, see 100% objective response rate, faster clinical response, and longer progression-free survival for mutational-MMRd patients vs. epigenetic-MMRd patients (44% ORR)
 - uncover two distinct axes of anti-tumor immunity in mutational vs. epigenetic MMRd tumors
## Results
### The molecular mechanism of mismatch repair deficiency impacts tumor mutation burden and response to immunotherapy
 - group patients into mutational or epigenetic MMRd by MLH1 promoter methylation analysis, whole exome sequencing, PCR, immunohistochemistry for MMR proteins, get 6 mutational and 18 epigenetic MMRd patients
 - PD-1 blockade (treated every 3 weeks) responders defined as patients with > 30% decrease in tumor size, all mutational and 44% of epigenetic MMRd patients responded to PD-1 blockade
 - faster response kinetics in mutational MMRd patients, also longer progression-free survival and overall survival compared to epi-MMRd patients
 - **don't observe differences in tumor mutational burden between responders and non-responders within each group (i.e. MMRd type), so while mutational MMRd has higher TMB and higher response rate, it's not the whole picture**
### Association between specific gene mutations and immunotherapy response
 - find commonly mutated genes: PTEN, ARID1A, RPL22, KMT2B, and KMT2D
 - mutations in ARID1A (subunit of BAF SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, commonly mutated in cancer) and CTCF (TF for 3D chromatin organizer, binding sites often mutated in cancer) associaed with PD-1 blockade response
 - ARID1A deficiency associated previosuly with enhanced ICB responsiveness, but here they see the opposite (mutations associated with PD-1 blockade resistance)
 - prior studies have indicated that JAK1 mutations can protect tumor cells from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxicity by disabling IFN-γ pathway signal transduction, JAK1 loss suggested to confer ICB resistance
 - 42% of tumors in this study had pathogenic/deleterious JAK1 mutations before treatment, but pre-treatment JAK1 mutations are not found here to be associated with PD-1 blockade resistance (even slightly see the opposite), complete response observed in 3 paitnets with tumors largely comprised of JAK1-mutant cells
 - JAK1 mutations may be advantageous for endometrial cancer by subverting immuen surveillance, 3 patients' tumors acquire JAK1 mutations following PD-1 blockade, but pre-treatment JAK1 mutations don't necessarily confer PD-1 blockade resistance (3 tumors with complete PD-1 blockade response had near-clonal JAK1 mutations at baseline)
### Longitudinal single cell transcriptional profiling of circulating immune cells
 - they were interested in immunological mechanisms driving differential ICB responses across patients (tumor mutational burden alone couldn't explain)
 - paired scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq on over 260,000 PBMCs (n = 52 samples)
 - compare relative frequencies of cell types across timepoints and patient categories, do not see differences
### Mutational MMRd is associated with effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses
 - prior to ICB, mutational MMRd (but not epigenetic MMRd) had enrichment for specific subpopulations of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (high expression of KLRG1, EOMES, LAG3, lower expression of inhibitory receptors PDCD1, CTLA4, KLRC1 encoding NKG2A) compared to non-responders, indicative of a poised subpopulation
 - after ICB, mutR patients enriched for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subpopulations (elevated expression of cytolytic effectors GZMB, GNLY, TNF but not IFNG, reduced expression of inhibitory receptors TIM-3, PDCD1, LAG3), epiR patients didn't show this, indicative of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population in mutR patients
 - no differences in TCR clonality (Simpson's clonality index) among patient categories before/after ICB, but increased clonality in responders, particularly subset of mutR patients
 - use pre-treatment bulk TCR-seq data from TILs, create reference library of tumor-reactive TCRs in patients, identify tumor-reactive clonotypes among peripheral T cells
 - quantify percentage of circulating T cells with TIL-matching TCR sequences in each sample, no differences prior to treatment but increase in TIL-matched circulating T cells in mutR patients compared to NR, in line with expansion of peripheral T cell populations with ICB
 - patients with JAK1-mutant tumors don't have systemic differences in composition of circulating immune response
### Distinct transcriptional profiles of circulating immune cells in epigenetic MMRd responders
 - unlike mutR patients, epiR patients had similar TMB as NR patients and didn't show enrichment for activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, so mutational vs. epigenetic mechanism of MMRd affects intensity of microsatellite instability
 - wanted to study transcriptional profiles of epi-MMRd tumors that respond vs. don't respond to PD-1 blockade
 - random sample to partition cells in each sample into "pseudobulk" profiles (5 for each cell type), then perform DEG analysis using generalized linear model as implemented in DESeq2 to equally weight each sample and not overcount single cells as independent events
 - CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells in epiR patients show strong upregulation of genes involved in proteasome, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, oxidative phosphorylation, and NOD-like receptor signaling (not seen in mutR patients), so prior to PD-1 blockade CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells in epiR patients were transcriptionally distinct from those in NR patients
 - after PD-1 blockade, activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in epiR patients showed upregulation of genes involved in NOD-like receptor signaling and FA metabolism, mutR-specific downregulation in NK cells after treatment
 - transcriptional profiles of T and NK cell populations in epiR patients are distinct from those of NR and mutR patients, both before and after pembrolizumab treatment
### Activated NK cells are associated with survival in endometrial cancer
 - DEG analyses pointed to enhanced functionality of NK cells in epiR patients compared to NR patients
 - hypothesis: NK cells might be responsible for promoting anti-tumor responses in epiR patients
### Transcriptional signatures of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells in epigenetic MMRd responders are associated with longer survival
## Discussion
 - epiMMRd tumor gene expression of key genes could vary (more than in "static" mutational sense) across cells/time
 - NK cells may play a larger role in epiMMRd anti-tumor response as they can efficiently mount cytotoxic responses in a neoantigen-independent manner (lower tumor mutational burden for epiMMRd than mutMMRd)
# Distinct molecular and immune hallmarks of inflammatory arthritis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer therapy
 - prior literature: ICB drug matters (CTLA-4 blockade has more colitis, skin toxicities and more irAEs in general, PD-1 blockade has more pneumonitis, hypothyroidism, vitiligo)
 - **proliferating (cycling) T cells up in synovial fluid compared to PBMCs in arthritis-irAE patients, as were Tregs among other cells**
 - review for me: IFNγ (Th1/Tc1), IL-4 (Th2/Tc2), IL-17 (Th17/Tc17), IL-10 (Tregs), Il-21 (Tfh), Tc meaning CD8 (cytotoxic T)
 - Th1 (IFNγ)-CD8 T axis in blood and inflammed joints of arthritis-irAE patients
 - CX3CR1<sup>high</sup> CD8 T cells in blood and CXCR3<sup>high</sup> CD8 T cells in synovial fluid (joints) are highly clonally expanded and share TCR repertoires
 - arthritis after combination ICB has enhanced Th17 and transient Th1/17 signatures
 - **Tregs seem more suppressive/effector in synovial fluid than in blood, surprising but consistent with Tregs up in irAE tissue it seems, perhaps it means that T cells in irAE tissue are more resistant to Treg suppression and/or irAE tissue Tregs might have different targets they are suppressing**
# Distinct pretreatment innate immune landscape and posttreatment T cell responses underlie immunotherapy-induced colitis
 - increased baseline circulating monocytes in colitis patients, monocytic infiltration at normal/inflamed colon regions
 - **greater expansion of T cells following ICB in colitis patients, expansion of CD8 Trms (locally induced) and Th1 CD4s (systemic i.e. recruited from blood)**
 - **surprisingly don't see T cell expansion differences between ICB responders/nonresponders**
 - **evidence here supports Th1 immunity driving ICI-colitis**
 - **specificity of T cells driving colitis likely autoantigens or commensal microbial antigens**
 - **vedolizumab (irAE treatment drug) likely works by blocking recruitment of systemically expanded Th1 cells via α4β7 integrin block**
# Divergent clonal differentiation trajectories establish CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cell heterogeneity during acute viral infections in humans
## Abstract
 - decrease in human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clonal diversity from acute (days 10-30) to memory phase (days 90-150 for early memory, day 500+ for late memory)
 - clonally biased differentiation trajectories of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in primary responses
 - clonally skewed CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cell differentiation in secondary recall responses
 - gap in field: how do individual T cell clones contribute to heterogeneity (CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to antigen composed of many T cell clones with unique TCRs forming heterogeneous repertoire of effector and memory cells) throughout immune responses?
 - here, they track human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones expanding in response to yellow fever virus vaccination at single cell level, observe drop in clonal diversity from acute to memory phase, suggesting that clonal selection shapes the circulating memory repertoire
## Introduction
 - primary adaptive immune responses lead to clonal expansion of rare, antigen-specific naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and generation of long-lived memory cells that guard against subsequent infections
 - human memory T cell subsets based on CCR7 and CD45RA expression (T<sub>SCM</sub> i.e. stem memory, T<sub>CM</sub> i.e. naive central memory, T<sub>EM</sub> i.e. effector memory, T<sub>EMRA</sub> i.e. effector memory re-expressing CD45RA)
 - T<sub>SCM</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> are naive-like, multipotent, re-establish CD8<sup>+</sup> effector repertoire upon reinfection, and express CCR7, CD127, TCF-1, LEF1, CD27 while T<sub>EM</sub> and T<sub>EMRA</sub> are more similar to activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, are primed cytotoxic effectors that circulate non-lymphoid tissue (first line of defense against subsequent infections), and express granzyme A/B, CD94, and CD57
 - protective roles of these memory T cell subsets is context dependent (i.e. some might be more protective than others against certain infections or tumors)
 - acute infections generate large effector responses, gradually giving rise to more abundant T<sub>CM</sub> or T<sub>SCM</sub> after resolution of the response
 - recurring/chronic infections progressively generate larger T<sub>EM</sub> populations (constant reactivation of existing memory cells)
 - many markers used to characterize CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CCR7, CD45RA, CD27) have continuous rather than strict binary expression patterns (continuum of cell states ranging from naive i.e. Th0 to highly differentiated effector)
## Results
### Clonal diversity in circulating YFV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells drops from acute to memory phase of the response
### Peripheral clonal expansions during the acute response do not predict clonal contributions to the circulating memory T cell repertoire
 - the decline in diversity suggests that clonal selection plays a role in shaping the circulating memory repertoire after vaccination
 - clonal expansion in acute response inversely linked with likelihood of differentiation into long-lived memory T cell clone
### Diverse memory phenotypes emerge after resolution of the acute phase of the response to YFV vaccination
 - virus-specific memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibit wide range of variable cell states rather than discrete identities
### Coupling clonality to cellular identity by scRNA-seq identifies unique clonal origins of long-lived T<sub>EMRA</sub> and T<sub>SCM</sub>
 - track phenotypic evolution of cells from individual T cell clones to understand how CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones contribute to different phenotypes emerging during the acute-to-memory transition
 - clonal fates skewed towards T<sub>SCM</sub> or T<sub>EMRA</sub> phenotype in memory phase
### Individual CCR7<sup>+</sup> T<sub>SCM</sub>, CD127<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub>, and CD127<sup>-</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> memory T cells give rise to distinct effector progeny following secondary reactivation
 - previously thought that T<sub>EM</sub> and T<sub>EMRA</sub> only generate short bursts of highly cytotoxic effector cells
 - see higher PD-1 expression (stronger regulation predisposition) in progeny derived from T<sub>EMRA</sub> compared to T<sub>SCM</sub>
### CD94 and CD62L delineate heterogeneous effector T cell subsets generated in recall responses *in vitro*
### Diverse effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell progeny generated in recall responses to YFV and influenza antigens are composed of distinct T cell clones
# Divergent clonal differentiation trajectories of T cell exhaustion
 - chronic antigen exposure leads to T cell exhaustion with reduced effector function
 - do all antigen-specific T cell clones follow the same T<sub>ex</sub> differentiation trajectory?
 - results: high T cell receptor signaling aviditiy correlates with T<sub>ex</sub> terminal phenotype, low avidity correlates with effector-like T<sub>ex</sub> KLR fate (so higher signaling response from TCR activation leads to higher exhaustion)
# Divergent outcomes of anti-PD-L1 treatment coupled with host-intrinsic differences in TCR repertoire and distinct T cell activation states in responding versus non-responding tumors
 - squamous cell carcinoma mouse model
 - treatment efficacy requires CD8 T cells, positively correlates with effector functions of CD8 TILs
 - TCR repertoire similarly expanded in both responders and non-responders, but most expanded clonotypes are not the same between responders and non-responders CD8 TILs (private? same between all responder CD8 TILs?)
 - responder and non-responder CD8 TILs RNA phenotype similar
# Divergent tumor and immune cell reprogramming underlying immunotherapy response and immune-related adverse events in lung squamos cell carcinoma
 - scRNAseq before/after ICI
 - increased proportions of macrophage subcluster with highly expressed SPP1, tumor tumor cell subclusters in irAE patients
 - TNF signaling pathway conversely associated with treatment efficacy and irAE development in most macrophage and tumor cell subclusters
 - cell-cell communications for TNF ligand-receptor pairs between macrophage/T cells and tumor cells bidirectionally remodeled in responders vs. non-responders and irAE vs. non-irAE patients
 - enhanced macrophage abundance and TNF signaling in on-treatment tumors and organs developing irAEs
 - increased circulating TNF protein in plasma/serum of irAE patients but not ICI responders
 - Th17 abundance didn't change in irAE group, nor was Th17 identified in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumors
# Dual targeting of CTLA-4 and CD47 on Treg cells promotes immunity against solid tumors
 - Treg infiltration into tumors correlates with poor prognosis (prior literature), which makes sense **and doesn't track with higher Tregs in irAE tissue which I don't understand**
 - they hypothesize here that **irAEs are likely due to blocking effect of anti-CTLA-4 on peripheral Tregs (higher CTLA-4 expression than effector T cells)**
# Dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to viral infection
 - more evidence for exhaustion of T cells being epigentic and driven by BATF, IRF4, also E2A, T-beet, TCF1, and NFAT, Nrf4a families
# Dynamic immune signatures as biomarkers for irAEs
 - summary of paper I've read
# Dynamics and survival associations of T cell receptor clusters in patients with pleural mesothelioma treated with immunotherapy
## Abstract
 - mesothelioma has low tumor mutational burden
 - use GIANA to cluster TCRs into shared antigen specificity groups
 - ICI-enhanced T-cell infiltration and expanded T cell diversity in tumors
 - high number of shared TCR clones between pretreatment tissue and circulation was associated with improved survival
# Dynamic single cell mapping unveils Epstein-Barr virus-imprinted T cell exhaustion and on-treatment response
## Abstract
 - Epstein-Barr virus associated gastric cancer exhibits an inflammed-immune phenotype, increased T and B cell infiltration
 - immunotherapy triggers clonal revival and reinvigoration of effector T cells
 - antigen-specific ISG-15<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population enriched in Epstein-Barr virus associated gastric cancer patients (transitory exhausted state)
 - baseline intratumoral ISG-15<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells predict immunotherapy responsiveness
 - re-emerged clonotypes of pre-existing ISG-15<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells found after treatment, gives rise to CXCL13-expressing effector population in responsive tumors
 - LAG-3 retention may render ISG-15<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into terminal exhaustion state in non-responsive tumors
 - anti-LAG-3 therapy could reduce tumor burden in refractory patients
## Introduction
 - PD-1 blockade only effective for ~10% of gastric cancer patients
 - Epstein-Barr virus associated gastric cancer is distinct, higher PD-1 blockade effectiveness (~25%)
 - Epstein-Barr virus can trigger T cell responses against abnormal antigens, perhaps leads to PD-1 blockade hypersensitivity as well
## Results
### Patient cohorts and study design
 - 6 male patients with gastric cancer, 3 with Epstein-Barr virus and 3 without, pre and post treatment so 12 samples
# Dynamics of T cell receptor repertoire in patients with ankylosing spondylitis after biologic therapy
 - ankylosing spondylitis: autoimmune condition
 - see that good responders to biologics have increased TCR repertoire diversity
 - positive correlation between TCR repertoire diversity and IL-23 levels
# Early changes in the circulating T cells are associated with clinical outcomes after PD-L1 blockade by durvalumab in advanced NSCLC patients
 - previous literature: increases in T cells after PD-L1 blockade
 - patients with higher TCR diversity on day 15 had better responses
# Early increase of circulating transitional B cells and autoantibodies to joint-related proteins in patients with metastatic melanoma developing checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis
 - CD19<sup>+</sup> B cell proportions higher in patients with irAEs
# Early rise in brain damage markers and high ICOS expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during checkpoint inhibitor-induced encephalomyelitis
 - ICOS expression on T cells mirrored severity of encephalomyelitis over course of recovery, also see ICOS expression on T cells of other patients with severe irAEs (moreso than in patients without irAEs)
# Editorial: quantification and prediction of T cell crossreactivity through experimental and computational methods
 - crossreactivity is the basis for heterologous immunity
 - computational tools for predicting crossreactivity: MatchTope (structure-based clustering of pMHCs likely to be recognized by same TCR), PepSim (also looks at pMHC structure for similarities), CrossDome (predicts risk for off-target toxicity in immunotherapy)
# Effective use of latent semantic indexing and computational linguistics in biological and biomedical applications
 - LSI = latent semantic indexing, computational linguistics technique, outperforms Boolean text searches and co-occurrence models at information retrieval, dimensional reduction technique used to compare concepts/topics among collection of terms
 - clustering genes/proteins into GO groups/signaling pathways relies on curation of these groups/pathways, could be supplemented by LSI/LSA (latent semantic analysis)
# Effect of age on the risk of immune-related adverse events in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - older adults had higher irAE risk in almost all organs
 - age-related irAE risk genes: ECM organiztion, JNK regulation, myeloid cell genes
# Effects of thymic selection of the T cell repertoire on HLA-class I associated control of HIV infection
 - HLA-B57 allele enriched in those with restricted HIV replication without therapy
 - **HLA-B57 restricted T cells are more crossreactive to mutants of target epitopes, this HLA allele also associated with autoimmunity**
# Egress of resident memory T cells from tissue with neoadjuvant immunotherapy: implications for systemic anti-tumor immunity
 - Trms express adhesion molecules and embed within tissues
 - **Trm promotion in tumors sequesters tumor-specific T cells out of circulation, this can limit systemic antitumor immunity**
 - **immunotherapy can promote egress of Trms from tumors into circulation**
# Elevated circulating memory T cells precede immunotherapy toxicities in melanoma
 - summary of a paper I've already read (*T cell characteristics associated with toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade in patients with melanoma*)
# Elucidating the heterogeneity of immunotherapy response and immune-related toxicities by longitudinal ctDNA and immune cell compartemtn tracking in lung cancer
 - TCR beta seq
 - data from 79 patients in 2 cohorts
 - paired analyses of peripheral TCRseq at baseline and on-treatment time points showed no significant changes in TCR clonotype abundances by clinical benefit **but did see on-treatment changes (more expanding and regressing clones) in circulating TCR clonotypes in patients with irAEs, perhaps surprising given correlation between irAE development and clinical benefit**
# Emerging concepts in T cell receptor specificity: rationalizing and (maybe) predicting outcomes
## Rules are made to be broken and roles are not easily defined
 - example: A6 TCR recognizes HTLV-1 Tax<sub>11-19</sub> peptide presented by MHCI HLA-A*0201, surprisingly strongest interaction in interface is between CDR3α and HLA-A2 (so peptide not involved surprisingly yet TCR is specific not degenerate)
## Rationalizing the specificity/cross-reactivity duality of TCRs
 - a single TCR has been shown to recognize > 1 million peptides
 - crossreactivity is needed as there are many more potential antigens than TCRs
 - hotspots/anchors can be important parts of peptides that must remain more constant for TCR binding, other parts of peptide can vary and allow crossreactivity, hotspots/anchors need not only bind CDRs
# Enhancer RNA-based modeling of adverse events and objective responses of cancer immunotherapy reveals associated key enhancers and target genes
 - predicting irAE risk from enhancer RNA expression
 - target genes of irAE-related enhancers (including upstream regulators of MYC) were involved in metabolism, inflammation, immune activation
 - target genes of objective response rate-related enhancers target *PAK2* and *DLG1* (participate in T cell activation)
# Entropic contributions and the influence of the hydrophobic environment in promiscuous protein-protein association
 - **trying to find evidence for increased hydrophobicity relating to cross-reactivity of TCRs: here they discuss how a particular PKA/AKAP interface demonstrates promiscuity in part due to the number of interactions this hydrophobic interface allows, which allows many alternative contacts (increased entropy, drives forward binding) with other binding partners hence promiscuity**
# EP08.01-009 TRBV haplotype profile was related to immune-induced adverse events in Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC
 - irAEs related to *TRBV* genes and uncommon V alleles
# Epigenetic regulation of monoallelic rearrangement (allelic exclusion) of antigen receptor genes
## Summary
 - ~10% of genes are expressed monoallelically (any given cell expressed only paternal or maternal allele but not both)
 - **antigen receptor genes in B and T cells are examples of genes expressed in monoallelic manner (allelic exclusion), during lymphocyte development only 1 allele of each antigen receptor undergoes V(D)J recombination at a time (rearrangement of second allele prevented once productive rearrangement of first allele senses)**
## Introduction
 - diploid genome benefits include more robust gene expression patterns, less susceptibility to mutations and environment
 - allelic exclusion benefits: greater cell diversity
 - monoallelic expression can be random (RME, like X inactivation) and non-random (imprinted genes)
 - **allelic exclusion for B and T cells can help prevent autoimmunity (expression of additional functional rearranged subunits from a second allele could lead to multiple specificities for a T or B cell)**
 - **TCRα locus uniquely has rearrangements from both alleles**
# Epigenetic regulation of T cell exhaustion
## Distinct epigenetic programs in T<sub>ex</sub> cells
 - T cells are directed by multiple signals (TCR-antigen interaction, co-stimulatory molecular interactions, local cytokines)
 - in acute infections where antigens can be cleared, most effector cells undergo apoptosis (i.e. they are short-lived effector cells or terminal effector i.e. TE cells, T-bet<sup>high</sup>) while a small fraction persist and differentiate into memory cells via memory precursor (MP, T-bet<sup>low</sup>) cells
 - key effector genes (like *Prf1*, *Gzmb*) demethylated and gain chromatin accessibility upon antigen recognition
 - after pathogen clearance, memory precursor cells can differentiate into long-lived memory cells by demethylating naive-associated genes (*Bcl2*, *Il7r*), demethylated and open chromatin at both effector and naive genes allowing rapid effector responses upon reencountering pathogens
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can become exhausted due to persistent antigen exposure, proliferating less, expressing inhibitory cell receptors (PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM3, LAG3), losing effector function
# Epitope spreading toward wild type melanocyte-lineage antigens rescues suboptimal immune checkpoint blockade responses
## Abstract
 - prior literature: ICI efficacy correlates with load of tumor-specific neoantigens and vitiligo development in patients with melanoma
 - here, they report that patients with low melanoma neoantigen burdens who did respond to ICIs had tumors with higher expression of pigmentation-related genes
 - **expansion of peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations specific for melanocyte antigens observed only in patients who responded to anti-PD-1 therapy, so ICI can promote breakdown of tolerance towards tumor-lineage self-antigens**
 - **mouse model of poorly immunogenic melanomas: skew epitope recognition toward wild type melanocyte antigens associated with improved anti-PD-1 efficacy (can introduce neoantigens with UVB radiation mutagenesis), and got long term protection against engrafted melanomas not sharing neoantigens**
## Results
### Recognition of wild type melanocyte antigens following immune checkpoint blockade in patients with melanoma
 - **immune activity against wild type melanocyte antigens in melanoma may contribute to ICB efficacy despite low neoantigen burden (i.e. perhaps in responders with low neoantigen tumors more often will see irAEs given necessity for immune activity against tumor associated antigens shared between tumor and self)**
## Discussion
 - **neoantigens may contribute to breaking of self-tolerance (toward wild type melanocyte self-antigens) in ICB**
# Evaluating T cell cross-reactivity between tumors and immune-related adverse events with TCR sequencing: pitfalls in interpretations of functional relevance
## Abstract
 - shared T cell clones between tumor and irAE evidence for crossreactivity **(or shared antigens)** underlying irAEs
## Introduction
 - correlation in response rate and irAE development also consistent with crossreactivity hypothesis
 - **crossreactivity here is shared antigen between tumor and self I believe**
## Discussion
 - large number and circulating nature of T cells predispose studies to false positives
# Exceptional response and multisystem autoimmune-like toxicities associated with the same T cell clone in a patient with uveal melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors
## Abstract
 - **identical CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clone found in 4 tissues in a patient with widespread irAEs (duodenum for enteritis irAE, PBMCs, original tumor and liver metastasis responses as well), evidence for crossreactivity underlying irAEs OR common antigen between tumor and self underlying irAEs**
## Discussion
 - tissue-resident memory T cells may underlie irAEs (common in barrier tissue)
 - **duodenitis blocked by antibody to integrin α 4 β 7 (LPAM-1) which blocks T cell infiltraton into GI tract, suggesting that GI toxicity resulted from circulating T cells trafficked to GI tract following expansion elsewhere i.e. in the tumor perhaps**
# Exhaust the exhausters: targeting regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment
 - Tregs can suppress anti-tumor immunity
# Expansion of pathogenic cardiac macrophages in immune checkpoint inhibitor myocarditis
 - murine model (*CTLA4+/- Pdc1-/-*)
 - increased levels of CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocyte-derived macrophages and CD8 T cells
# Expression of MHC class II in T cells is associated with increased HIV-1 expression
 - CD4 primary HIV-1 infection receptor, expressed on T cells, monocytes, macrophages, DCs
 - MHC class II molecules undetectable on resting T cells, expressed highly on activated T cells, unclear function (vs. clear antigen presentation function on APCs to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells), perhaps also antigen presentation
# External validation of biomarkers for immune-related adverse events after immune checkpoint inhibition
 - **unable to reliably predict risk of irAEs in most cases from pre-therapy flow cytometry and clinical data**

# Genetic variation associated with thyroid autoimmunity shapes the systemic immune response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade
## Abstract
 - study endocrine irAEs from 7 clinical trials across 6 cancers with PD-1 blockade combined with chemotherapy
 - PD-1 blockade induced thyroid dysfunction associated with longer survival, seen this before not super surprising (irAEs correlating with tumor regression)
# Genetic variation in MHC proteins is associated with T cell receptor expression biases
## Abstract
 - controversy over if germline-encoded TCR-MHC contacts promote TCR-MHC specificity, do differences exist in TCR V gene compatibilities with different MHC alleles?
 - result: *trans* associations between genetic variation and TCR V gene usage in humans
## Introduction
 - HLA genes highly polymorphic, variants associated with many traits, like most autoimmune diseases
 - perhaps different disease risk conferred by particular MHC alleles is due to differences in presented peptides or differences in stabilities of MHC molecules
 - **1-5% of T cells have γ (*TRG*) and δ (*TRD*) chains instead of α (*TRA*) and β (*TRB*) ones, only β and δ chains also have diversity (D) genes recombined in VDJ recombination (α and γ just have VJ recombination)**
 - **during V(D)J recombination, joints between segments are partially digested and nucleotides are randomly added (i.e. N region) to form highly variable and non-germline-encoded complementarity-determining regions 3 (CDR3) loop that recognizes peptides, CDR1/2 loops of TCR form contacts with MHC and are encoded by V genes**
# Genome-wide analysis identifies NR4A1 as a key mediator of T cell dysfunction
 - **they say T cells become dysfunctional when they encounter self antigens, perhaps because this is always a chronic stimulation then, i.e. leading to exhaustion?**
 - mice
 - NR4A1 (TF) expressed highly in tolerant T cells, OE of NR4A1 inhibits Teff differentiation, KO of NR4A1 overcomes tolerance and exagerates Teff function and enhances anti-tumor/chronic virus immunity
 - NR4A1 promotes H3K27ac, activating tolerance genes
# Genome-wide CRISPR screens of T cell exhaustion identify chromatin remodeling factors that limit T cell persistence
 - chronic stimulation assay
 - *in vivo* validation of screen results (perturbation of INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes improves T cell persistence in tumors)
# Germline genetic variants are associated with development of insulin-dependent diabetes in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - *NLRC5* germline mutation as potential predictive biomarker for T1D irAE
# Germline genetic variation and predicting immune checkpoint inhibitor induced toxicity
 - irAEs in ~10-55% of patients
 - endocrine/pneumonitis irAEs more common in younger patients, skin irAEs more common in older patients
 - thyroid irAEs more common in women, neurological, dermal, vascular irAEs more common in men
 - germline variants associated with irAE development: *GABRP*, *DSC2*, *BAZ2B*, *ZPLD1*, *MIR548AB*, *SEMA5A*, *LOC105374704*, *CDH6*, *OSBPL6*, *AGPS*...
# Germline immunomodulatory expression quantitative trait loci (ieQTLs) associated with immune-related toxicity from checkpoint inhibition
 - exploration of link between germline genetic variants controlling expression of immunomodulatory genes and irAE risk in melanoma patients treated with CTLA-4 blockade
 - results: variant allele linked to increased expression of *SYK* associated with increased risk of irAEs, not associated with response to CTLA-4 blockade
 - SYK involved in T/B cell expansion, pSYK increased in autoimmunity
# Germline variants associated with toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade
## Abstract
 - GWAS of 1,751 patients on ICIs across 12 cancer types
 - 3 genome-wide significant associations: one near *IL7* (regulator of lymphocyte homeostasis) in a new cryptic exon (patients with this variant had increased lymphocyte stability after ICI which predicted irAEs and improved survival), one near *IL22RA1*, and one on 4p15
## Main
 - hypothesis for irAE onset heterogeneity: impact of germline genetic determinants of immune activity
 - evidence for this hypothesis: polygenic risk for autoimmune conditions correlated with onset of cutaneous and thyroid irAEs
## Discussion
 - ***IL7* supports aberrant immune activity in autoimmunity, limits organ toxicity during antiviral immune response, blocks PD-1 leading to T1D (blocking checkpoint when it would have prevented autoimmunity, so IL7 acts as a natural ICB and is therefore rationally associated with irAEs**), can try *IL7* receptor blockade to treat *IL7*-irAEs
# Global analysis of shared T cell specificities in human non-small cell lung cancer enables HLA inference and antigen discovery
## Abstract
 - TILs crossreact to EBV antigens and shared tumor antigens
 - EBV-specific T cells expanded in patients responding to ICB
 - crossreactive CD8 T cells express GZMK
## Introduction
 - in tumors with no known viral etiology, have seen virus-specific (EBV, flu, CMV) TILs, thought to be bystanders (presumed to not recognize tumor antigens, but perhaps they do through crossreactivity)
 - **hundreds to thousands of same TCR can recognize single pMHC**
## Results
### Phenotypic characterization of TMEM161A-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in lung cancer
 - **T cells from tumor-enriched specificity (crossreactive?) group biased towards effector phenotype, express EOMES, KLRG1, GZMK (~activated NK)**
## Discussion
 - **autoreactive T cells in peripheral blood may exist (pruned but not clonally deleted thymus) in order to avoid immunologic "blind spots" to pathogens, i.e. pathogens that look like self would get by free otherwise if we didn't have some autoreactivity perhaps**
 - uncoupling of TCR binding from T cell activation may dampen anti tumor response in tumors
# Globally shared TCR repertoires within the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of patients with metastatic gynecological cancer
 - high TCR clone overlap between peripheral blood and multiple metastases (more overlap than between blood and single tumor sites), perhaps expanded from similar antigens or neoantigens shared among tumor tissues that drove clonal expansion of immune cells
 - previous literature: TILs in TME associated with improved survival
 - recirculation of T cells likely responsible for most of tissue-shared cloned in blood, but many tissue-shared clones could be bystander T cells
# GPR120 inhibits colitis through regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell IL-10 production
 - GPR120 implicated in regulating metabolism, inflammation
 - DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)-induced colitis model
 - mice
# Graft-versus-host disease versus graft-versus-leukemia
 - graft-versus-host is characterized by robust T cell activation and proliferation followed by infiltration of host target structures
 - it's less clear to what degree T cell activation and proliferation are required for effective graft-versus-leukemia, so perhaps controlling T cell proliferation can uncouple graft-versus-leukemia from graft-versus host
# Guidelines for bioinformatics of single cell sequencing data analysis in Alzheimer's disease: review, recommendation, implementation and application
## Quality control
 - remove sources of technical variation introduced during generation of scRNA data while maintaining true biological variation
 - scRNA is noisier than bulk RNA seq (low amount of RNA/cell, stochastic sampling process of sequencing)
 - many 0 or near-0 counts by "dropout" events
 - common quality control measures are number of expressed features (non-0 count feature detections) and library size (sum of counts across all features)
 - exclude cells with very few expressed features or small library size (low RNA-capture efficiency)
 - also exclude cells with abnormally high numbers of expressed features (doublet/multiplet)
 - lower and upper bounds can vary based on sequencing depth (deeper depth leads to more reads and more detected features irrespective of cell quality)
 - another approach is to remove outliers, for instance removing cells with log-library size greater than 3 median absolute deviations or below median log-library size
 - having a threshold for overall expression content (detected genes) can work to remove doublets, but not all cells contain the same amount of RNA
 - another approach is to look for cells expressing marker genes of > 1 distinct cell type, but this requires knowledge of the cell types and associated markers
 - other approaches include generating artificial doublets by mixing observed gene expression profiles from randomly selected droplet pairs, then embed/dimension reduce and classify to find doublets
 - mitochondrial mapping reads: increased mitochondrial fraction indicates apoptosis, cell stress, and/or loss of cytoplasmic RNA from lysed cells, a threshold of 10% is good for most human tissue although this too can vary (up to 30% is ok for heart muscle cells with their increased energy demand)
 - ambient RNA (from dead/apoptotic cells) can also contribute to noise: this contribution can be estimated by looking at background in "empty" droplets (i.e. droplets of just this ambient RNA), one can also use negative cell markers
## Normalization
 - many biological and technical factors, like sequencing depth, capture efficiency, and cell composition, can all affect observed scRNA read counts
 - normalization targets variance from sequencing (library preparation, high dropout events, amplification bias caused by gene length, GC content, etc.)
 - mitigation of batch effect (variance from experimental design and handling, like different sequencing platforms, timing, reagents, laboratories, etc.)
 - scaling normalization works to correct for sequence depth by dividing feature-level read counts by library size (total read counts within each sample) then multiplying by a constant (like 10,000), then add 1 before log-transforming (to prevent log(0)), but scaling normalization is biased towards highly expressed transcripts
 - other techniques include trimmed mean of M-values (TMM, calculates scaling factors by trimming away genes with extreme fold changes between samples, tends to overcorrect for scaling factors), upper-quantile method (UQ, uses per-sample upper-quantile, 75-th percentile, to scale counts, could be 0 for many cells with low sequencing depth), and relative log-expression (RLE, scales to pseudo-reference derived from geometric mean of gene counts across cells, doesn't work for genes with 0 counts)
 - other methods generally fall into cell-based normalization (estimate cell-specific global size factor to normalize all genes in same cell, pool cells to estimate more robust size factors then deconvolve pooled size factors to get cell-specific size factors) and gene-based normalization (parametric modeling of individual genes, **like Pearson residuals method SCTransform**, perform adjustments individually for each group of genes with different sequencing depths or different ranges of abundance levels)
## Feature selection and dimension reduction
 - identify few latent variables that explain the most variance in data
# Gut microbiota diversity and composition in predicting immunotherapy response and immunotherapy-related colitis in melanoma patients: a systematic review
 - Firmicutes phylum associated with good response to ICB and irAE colitis, Bacteroidales family associated with poor response to ICB, *Bacteroidetes* enrichment associated with irAE colitis resistance
 - higher gut microbiota diversity associated with more favorable response to ICB
# Gut microbiota signatures are associaed with toxicity to combined CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade
 - **severe irAE associated with more diverse baseline peripheral T cell repertoire, also more expanded clones (pre to on-treatment expanded) in severe irAE group**
 - upregulation of mucosal IL-1β in colitis samples, more abudant *Bacteroides intestinalis* as well
# Facts and hopes for prediction, diagnosis, and treatment of immune-related adverse events
 - factors associated with irAEs: pre-existing autoimmune disease, sex, BMI, response to ICI, circulating cytokines and immune cells, genetic variants, microbiome
# FDA approves anti-CD3 antibody to delay type 1 diabetes onset
 - T1D: autoreactive T cells destroy insulin secreting β cells
# From reads to insight: a hitchhiker's guide to ATAC-seq data analysis
 - ATAC-seq: genetically engineered hyperactive Tn5 transposase cuts open chromatin and leaves behind 9 bp staggered nick, ligates high-throughput sequencing adapters to regions, so nick is repaired leaving behind 9 bp duplication
 - pre-analysis: QC (FastQC base quality scores, GC content, sequence length distribution, sequence duplication levels, primer contamination, etc.) and alignment to reference genome (> 80% unique mapping rate is successful)
 - core analysis: peak (accessible region) calling, generally count-based (statistical methods to compare read distribution shape to random background)
 - advanced analysis: peak differential analysis and annotation, motif enrichment, footprinting, nucleosome position analysis
 - integration with multiomics
# From tumor mutational burden to blood T cell receptor: looking for the best predictive biomarker in lung cancer treated with immunotherapy
 - TMB doesn't correlate exactly with how many neoantigens are made or even presented by MHC, or recognized by T cell, so low mutational burden tumors can have neoantigens capable of generating strong antitumor T cell response (and vice versa)
 - association between antitumor response to ICB and irAE development may be due to TMB correlation (tumors with high TMB associated with more irAEs and better ICB response)
 - TRA and TRB (or TRD/TRG) joined by disulfides
 - CD3 and CD247 are invariant TCR chains
# Fulminant myocarditis with combination immune checkpoint blockade
## Abstract
 - myocarditis with robust T cell and macrophage infiltrates
 - **selective clonal T cell populations infiltrating myocardium identical to those in tumor and skeletal muscle**
## Discussion
 - possible mechanisms: T cells targeting shared antigen, T cells targeting homologous antigens (different but similar?), T cells targeting dissimilar antigens (what I'm thinking of as crossreactivity)
 - evidence for shared antigen mechanism: high levels of muscle-specific antigens (desmin and troponin) in both patient tumors
# Functionally specialized human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets express physiochemically distinct TCRs
 - **CDR3s of effector/memory Tregs had most hydrophobic and strongly interacting residues which might promote crossreactivity, recapitulated features in naive Tregs suggesting lineage fate predetermined by selection events in thymus, also short CDR3s which might limit crossreactivity**
# Hallmarks of response, resistance, and toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade
## Other immune checkpoints: positive immune regulation
 - ICOS (immune co-stimulator) expressed on T cells, enhances function/expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and Tregs
 - possibly could use ICOS agonist monoclonal antibodies for immunotherapy
## Factors impacting response and resistance to ICB
### Host-intrinsic factors
 - tumor mutational burden (total number of distinct mutations per coding area of tumor genome) helps explain ICB response (higher burden for example in environmental DNA damage associated melanoma, lung/bladder cancer better response with more neoantigens)
# Hierarchical transcriptional network governing heterogeneous T cell exhaustion and its implications for immune checkpoint blockade
 - PD-1 stabilizes TCF-1<sup>+</sup> Tex precursor pool (that maintains a chronically stimulated Tex pool)
# High-affinity oligoclonal TCRs define effective adoptive T cell therapy targeting mutant KRAS-G12D
 - only mutant G12D but not WT peptides stabilized HLA-C*08:02 (critical anchor salt bridge to HLA-C), so instance of no/less crossreactivity between TCR and WT/mutant peptide
# High IGKC-expressing intratumoral plasma cells predict response to immune checkpoint blockade
 - potential new dataset
# High-throughput and single cell T cell receptor sequencing technologies
## Introduction
 - diversity (D) gene segment only contributes to TCRβ
 - VDJ gene segments, also the constant (C) gene segment
 - recombination of gene segments and non-templated addition or deletion of nucleotides between spliced gene segments (junctions, like CDR1-3 **I think**) generate diverse TCR repertoire
 - complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) is the most diverse, hypervariable
 - unlikely that an individual will have two T cells with the same TCR sequence, so TCR sequences are used as unique identifiers of T cell clones
 - naive T cell repertoire is highly diverse, memory T cells much less so
## Amplification strategies for TCR sequencing
### Multiplex PCR
 - use a pool of primers to bind diverse TCR V genes
 - set of forward primers complementary to all known V genes, set of reverse primers for either J or C regions, depending on if starting with gDNA or cDNA, respectively
### 5' RACE
 - reverse transcribe RNA with enzyme with terminal transferase activity to add untemplated C nucleotides to 3' end of cDNA
 - template switch oligonucleotide (TSO) containing complementary poly(G) stretch anchors to this untemplated region of C nucleotides and allows reverse transcriptase to switch templates and extend cDNA to end of TSO which includes a common adaptor sequence
 - result is that one pair of primers targeting 5' adaptor and constant region is able to amplify all TCR rearrangements
# High-throughput immune repertoire analysis with IGoR
 - IGoR (Inference and Generation Of Repertoires)
 - quantitative characterization of the statistics of receptor generation
 - each receptor sequence can be generated in a large number of ways, which they call “scenarios,”: recombination of germline segments, insertions and deletions, and hypermutations (BCRs)
 - different germline segments can recombine with each other with different frequencies, and the number of insertions and deletions is random, so the overall receptor generation process cannot be described deterministically
 - IGoR starts by listing the possible recombination and hypermutation scenarios leading to an observed sequence in the data set, then assigns probability weights reflecting the likelihood of these scenarios, IGoR restricts its exploration to the reasonably likely ones to save on computational cost
 - computational pipeline: V(D)J recombination proceeds by joining randomly selected segments (V, D, and J segments in the case of TRB and IGH), each segment gets trimmed at its ends (hashed areas), and a varying number of non-templated insertions are added between them, IGoR lists putative recombination scenarios consistent with the observed sequence, and weighs them according to their likelihood, the likelihood of each scenario is computed using a Bayesian network of dependencies between the recombination features (V, D, J segment choices, insertions, and deletions)
# *HLA* autoimmune risk alleles restrict the hypervariable region of T cell receptors
 - little prior evidence for hypothesis that *HLA* risk alleles may influence thymic selection to increase frequency of autoreactive T cells (central hypothesis)
 - could also be due to peripheral hypothesis (*HLA* risk alleles increasing presentation of autoantigens in periphery to T cells)
 - *HLA-DRB1* site 13 influences CDR3 AA composition, evidence for central hypothesis?
 - RA characterized by reaction to citrullinated antigens
# *HLA-DQA1* and *HLA-DQB1* in Celiac disease predisposition: practical implications of the HLA molecular typing
 - HLA class I and II genes code for cell surface glycoproteins important for antigen presentation and self-recognition by immune cells
 - HLA class I heterodimers consist of α-heavy chain (encoded by *HLA-A/B/C*) and small β-microglobulin
 - HLA class II heterodimers (α and β chains) specified by genes in HLA-D region (*DPA/B1*, *DQA/B1*, *DRB1/A*)
# HLA-A*03 and response to immune checkpoint blockade in cancer: an epidemiological study
 - HLA-A*03 associated with reduced survival after ICB, perhaps this allele impairs priming and effector T cell function
# HLA-dependent variation in SARS-CoV-2 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell crossreactivity with human coronaviruses
## Abstract
 - human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause common cold
 - public TCR repertoires dominated by TCRs cognate to non-homologous SARS-CoV-2 peptides
 - skewed distribution of TCRs cognate to homologous or non-homologous peptides in COVID-19 patients likely HLA-dependent
## Discussion
 - T cells specific to SARS-CoV-2 peptides with high similarity to human CoV predicted pMHC can be expanded from naive indivduals, cognate public TCRs observed in some COVID-19 recovered patients
 - SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals can mount T cell responses to HCoVs that, due to peptide similarity, can be crossreactive with SARS-CoV-2 antigens
 - **certain HLA alleles (HLA‐B*07:02, ‐C*07:02, ‐A*03:01) predispose to SARS‐CoV‐2‐HCoV cross‐reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells**
 - non-specific antiviral immune responses can lead to the release of self-antigens from damaged cells, resulting in bystander activation of autoreactive T cells
 - immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides similar to self antigens may be candidates for autoimmune associations
# HLA-DRB1*0405 is involved in the development of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease-like immune-related adverse events in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease-like uveitis is a common form of ICI-associated uveitis (ICIU)
 - 5 of ICIU cases here were VKH-like ICIUs (4/5 positive for HLA-DRB1*0405), 4 not (3 negative for HLA-DRB-04:05)
# Holistic approach to immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events
 - irAEs usually occur within the first months after ICI treatment but can develop as early as after the first dose or as late as years after ICI treatment
 - glucocorticoids are usually used to manage irAEs, other immunosuppressive agents as well
 - CTLA-4 on T cells (mostly CD4<sup>+</sup>) interacts with CD80/86 on antigen presenting cells (outcompetes CD28 for CD80/86), CTLA-4 modulates T<sub>regs</sub> (gatekeepers for prevention of autoimmunity)
 - PD-1 on T cells (mostly CD8<sup>+</sup>) interacts with PD-L1 on tumor cells and antigen presenting cells
 - endocrinopathies (T1D, hypothyroidism) and rheumatological toxicities (arthritis) are most common chronic irAEs
 - **shared antigens between tumor and peripheral normal tissue may drive both antitumor responses and organ-specific autoimmunity, activating tumor/auto-reactive T cells**
 - organ-specific autoantibodies can predict organ-specific irAEs
 - baseline immune cell profiles are being studied as predictors of irAEs: high CD2<sup>low</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> B cells, high eosinophil count, high proliferation of control memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, higher expression of CD27/28 on CD4/8 effector T cells, increased activated CD4 memory T cells and TCR diversity
# Host-specific differences in top-expanded TCR clonotypes correlate with divergent outcomes of anti-PD-L1 treatment in responders versus non-responders
 - murine
# How the thymus designs antigen-specific and self-tolerant T cell receptor sequences
## Introduction
 - **TCRs recognize antigens via multiple modest interactions, so mutations to most amino acids abrogate recognition (conferring specificity)**
 - positive selection is important for MHC restriction but not antigen specificity
 - **past studies: negative selection reduces TCR crossreactivity**
## Results
### Selection against many endogenous pMHC molecules is required for antigen-specific TCR sequences
 - as previously seen
### Negative selection against many peptides results in TCR sequences with peptide contact residues enriched in weakly interacting amino acids
 - when there are many peptides in thymus, CDR3s of TCRs enriched in amino acids that interact weakly with other amino acids, strong interactions in the case where there are few peptides in thymus
# Human leukocyte antigen genotype association with the development of immune-related adverse events in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with single agent immunotherapy
 - **homozygosity at >= 1 HLA-I locus associated with reduced irAE risk, perhaps due to less diverse peptide presentation i.e. less self-peptides presented**
 - HLA-A3 supertype (incuding various similar HLA-A alleles) associated with increased irAE risk
# Human T cell development, localization, and function throughout life
## Changes in T cells throughout life
 - early life (infancy and early childhood): most T cells are naive, also Tregs, greatest number of new antigens are encountered, naïve T cells play key protective roles in fending off pathogens, Treg cells are critical for developing tolerance to innocuous and ubiquitous antigens, and long-term reserves of memory T cells are established
 - childhood-adulthood: memory T cells accumulate with antigen experience, with the level of memory T cell accumulation plateauing in adulthood and maintained over decades
 - adulthood: fewer new antigens are encountered and tolerance establishment may be less prevalent, with the role of T cells shifting to maintain homeostasis and immunoregulation in the context of repeat and chronically encountered antigens, with surveillance for tumors also important during this period
 - late life: increased inflammation and a decline in T cell functionality, contributing to immune dysregulation and associated pathology
## T cell localization
 - most T cells in lymphoid tissue (bone marrow, spleen, tonsils, and the 500-700 lymph nodes), also many T cells in mucosal sites (lungs, intestines) and skin, 2-3% of all T cells in peripheral blood
## Thymopoiesis
 - progenitors from bone marrow lacking CD4/CD8 undergo TCR rearrangement to generate CD4<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive thymocytes in thymus
 - Tregs are ~10% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (more in early life, ~10-30%, and less later in life, ~5%)
 - humans born with full complement of T cells (unlike mice who are born lymphopenic)
 - majority of naive T cells derive from peripheral turnover in humans (unlike mice, majority from thymus even in old mice)
 - naive T cells significant proportion (~20-50%) of T cells in lymph nodes decades after thymic output stops
## T cell effector and memory differentiation
 - clonal expansion (activated pathogen-specific T cells expand and differentiate into effector T cells), contraction (majority of effector T cells die by apoptosis following clearance of pathogen), and memory (some primed T cells persist as long term memory T cells to protect against subsequent infections even decades later)
# Hydrophobic CDR3 residues promote the development of self-reactive T cells
 - **hydrophobicity at positions 6 and 7 of CDR3 β promote development of self-reactive T cells**
# ICBcomb: a comprehensive expression database for immune checkpoint blockade combination therapy
 - human and mouse expression data from combination ICB
 - 1399 samples across 29 cancer types, 52 drugs
# Identification of antigen-specific TCR sequences based on biological and statistical enrichment in unselected individuals
 - biological (FACS, TCR beta seq) and statistical methods
 - most antigen-specific TCRs in VDJdb come from pMHC-multimer (tetramer) binding FACS experiments, which has the drawbacks of limited throughput and can only be used with T cell donors with genetically matched HLA alleles
 - **I think all they do is compare TCR repertoires between antigen-activated and resting pools to find enriched TCRs in antigen-activated pools to call antigen-specific, not *de novo* identifying antigen-specific TCRs as would be nice**
 - **public peanut antigen-specific CDR3s are more germline-like (fewer N-nucleotide insertions than private ones) and show evidence of convergent recombination**
# Identification of neoantigens for individualized cancer immunotherapy
 - neoepitopes are attractive targets for therapeutic cancer vaccines, **but most cancer mutations are unique for individual patients (neoantigenome), requiring individualized treatment**
 - **not all tumor mutations give rise to neoantigens, neoepitope-specific T cells reflect only 1-2% of mutations in an individual tumor, this could be due to not all tumor mutations giving rise to neoantigens and from T cell repertoire not recognizing all neoantigens perhaps as well**
 - **cross-reactivity is possible due to low affinity of functional TCR-pMHC interaction**
 - **heterologous immunity refers to crossreactive T cells induced by unrelated antigen, often pre-existent before tumor onset (like gut microbiota or infections)**
 - **MHC-I encoded in HLA-A/B/C, MHC-II encoded in HLA-DP/DQ/DR**
# Identification of pathogenic immune cell subsets associated with checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis
## Abstract
 - patients with ICI myocarditis have lymphocytic infiltrates in the heart, implicating T cell mediated mechanisms
 - find expansion of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector cells re-expressing CD45RA (Temra CD8<sup>+</sup>> T cells) in ICI myocarditis patients compared to controls
 - these CD8<sup>+</sup> Temra cells were clonally expanded, express proinflammatory cytokines (CCL5/CCL4/CCL4L2), they progress into exhausted phenotype 2 months after treatment with glucocorticoids
## Results
### Analysis of immune cell populations in ICI myocarditis using CyTOF reveals cytotoxic Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> expansion
 - reduction in circulating T/B cells, increase in monocytes/macrophages, increased Tregs, reduced naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, increased Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in ICI-treated groups
 - increased Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in ICI myocarditis vs. other ICI groups
### Global analysis of immune cell populations in ICI myocarditis using scRNA-seq corroborates CyTOF results
 - increase in monocytes, reduction in circulating T cells in ICI-treated groups
### Confirmation of myocarditis-associated Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> expansion by scRNA-seq
 - increase in Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> in ICI-treated groups and in myocarditis group relative to other ICI groups
 - these Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cells expressed high levels of cytotoxicity/activation genes like granzyme B (GZMB), IL-32, CCL5 (chemokine), so they seem cytotoxic
 - don't see unique CD4<sup>+</sup> subpopulation differences
### Single cell TCR sequencing reveals myocarditis-associated clonal expansion of cytotoxic Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cell clusters
 - 83% of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells express α β TCRs, **I think expected frequency is ~95-99%**
 - identify top 50 clonotypes for each patient
 - find expansion of top 50 clonotypes in ICI myocarditis group relative to no ICI and non-myocarditis irAEs (i.e. for myocarditis group the top 50 clonotypes constitute a higher percentage of the CD3<sup>+</sup> cells so they're more expanded)
 - myocarditis expansion mostly in Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cells
 - myocarditis-associated clusters had somewhat high pro-inflammatory and cytotoxicity markers
### Activated and expanded Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> clones in myocarditis transition from an early cytotoxic phenotype to a late exhaustion phenotype over time
 - have data for 1 myocarditis patient for longitudinal study (2 months)
 - persistence of clonally expanded Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in myocarditis patient even after clinical indices of inflammation resolve
 - top 10 clonotypes first belong to Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> but switch to central/effector memory over time
 - early see cytotoxic and chemokine (recruitng immune/inflammatory cells) transcriptomic programs that become attenuated over time, see increase in exhaustion markers over time
### Ligand-receptor analysis of myocarditis-associated T cell populations exhibits interactions with other immune cell types through cardiotropic chemokines
 - use CellPhoneDB algorithm to predict potential ligand-receptor interactions in scRNA-seq data
 - find interactions between ligands expressed by Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cells with members of innate immune system (DCs, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils) via pro-inflammatory crosstalk between CCL5-CCR1 and TNF superfamily members
 - more pro-inflammatory (vs. anti-inflammatory) interactions in ICI-treated groups
 - myocarditis group had lack of key interaction between CD52 and SIGLEC10 (T cell interaction), **also seen lacking in T1D!**
## Discussion
 - they hypothesize that the systemic inflammatory response in ICI myocarditis patients may be greater than that in the relatively milder irAEs in the other group (and in the non-irAE group too), leading to a greater effector T cell expansion in the peripheral blood
 - Temra CD8<sup>+</sup> cells previously shown to be expanded in peripheral blood of patients with autoimmune diseases, like RA
 - don't see Th17 effector cell increases in heart as previously seen, although perhaps this is because it was previously seen in autoimmunity vs. irAE?
# Identifying specificity groups in the T cell receptor repertoire
 - TCR sequences are diverse
 - here, they define the minimal requirements for TCR antigen specificity through analysis of TCR sequences using a panel of pMHC tetramer sorted cells and structural data
 - GLIPH algorithm: grouping of lymphocyte interactions by paratrope hotspots, clusters TCRs with high probability of sharing specificity owing to conserved motifs and similarity of CDR3 sequences
# IL-2 delivery by engineered mesenchmal stem cells re-invigorates CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to overcome immunotherapy resistance in cancer
 - mice
 - engineered MSCs to deliver IL-2 mutein dimer to TILs to activate and expand pre-existing CD8 TILs
 - insufficient IL-2 limits CD8 TIL expansion as tumors progress
 - expanded TILs also exit through draining LN to control distal tumor(s)

# Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced thyroid disorders: a single center experience
 - thyroid irAEs emerge after median time of 9 weeks, mainly in females
 - regardless of initial presentation, all irAE thyroidits patients later developed persistent hypothyroidism requiring hormone replacement (levothyroxine), increased TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) after ICI in these atients
# Immune checkpoint inhibitor rechallenge after immune-related adverse events in patients with cancer
 - ~29% recurrence rate of same irAE that prompted discontinuation of ICI therapy after rechallenge with same ICI
 - colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis more common than other irAEs among patients who had recurrence
# Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related thyroid dysfunction
 - thyroid irAEs usually destructive thyroiditis or hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) is rare
 - thyroid irAE development associated with prolonged survival in NSCLC patients
 - higher incidence of thyroid irAEs for patients with anti-thyroid antibodies at baseline
 - T cells involved in destructive thyroiditis, perhaps moreso CD4 T cells

 - **skin commensals can unleash aberrant commensal-specific T cell responses in ICI therapy, leading to skin irAEs**
# Immune checkpoint inhibitor use in patients with cancer and pre-existing autoimmune diseases
 - **TNF or IL-6 inhibitors may help ICIs with anti-tumor response while also preventing severe irAEs**
 - link between autoimmunity and cancer: chronic inflammation and immunosuppression can lead to cancer, cancer can also lead to autoimmunity (paraneoplastic syndrome: manifestations in organs distant from tumor)
 - expansion of T cells associated with irAEs, also makes sense with being associated with anti-tumor response so could be covariate
# Immune checkpoint receptors in autoimmunity
## Coordinated expression of checkpoint receptors on T cells
 - loss of a single checkpoint receptor as been associated with compensatory upregulation of other inhibitors molecules
## Heterogeneity of autoreactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at sites of inflammation
 - heterogeneity exists among exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, including a self-renewing stem-like population that gives rise to terminally differentiated subsets expressing high levels of coinhibitory molecues
 - **immune checkpoint molecules may promote long-term survival and tissue adaptation of autoreactive T cells**
## The reservoir of autoreactive T cells
 - reservoir of stem-like autoreactive T cells outside inflammed organ
## Parallels to immune-related adverse events with immune checkpoint blockade
 - tissue infiltration of proliferative Th1-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing checkpoint receptors in irAEs
 - **shared clonal origin among CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at site of colitis with gut T<sub>RM</sub> cells, suggesting clonal expansion from T<sub>RM</sub> population being responsible for irAEs, distinct from autoimmunity it seems**
 - arthritis irAE: shared clonality between CD8<sup>+</sup> CX3CR1<sup>high</sup> effector phenotype in peripheral blood and CXCR3<sup>+</sup> CXCR6<sup>high/low</sup> effector memory or terminally differentiated effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> in synovial fluid, implying active tracking and differentiation from peripheral blood to synovial fluid, also evidence for expansion of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in mice joints
 - **for tissues that lack T<sub>RM</sub> cells, like the synovium, trafficking of T cells from the periphery may be important for irAEs**
# Immune checkpoint status and exhaustion-related phenotypes of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from the tumor-draining regional lymph nodes in breast cancer
 - regional lymph node subpopulation expressing PD-1, CXCR5, TIM-3, ICOS, reduced IFN-γ production, perhaps able to be rejuvenated by ICI
 - CXCR5 and ICOS mark CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset (Tfh), involved in formation of germinal centers, help B cells produce antibodies
# Immune checkpoints are predominantly co-expressed by clonally expanded CD4<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>+</sup> intratumoral T cells in primary human cancers
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (~40%), CD4<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>-</sup> T cells (~40%), and CD4<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T cells (~10%) proprtions consistent across patients in tumors
 - stimulatory (CD25, CD28, 4-1BB, ICOS, OX40) and inhibitory (PD-1, CTLA-4, PD-L1, CD39, TIGIT) checkpoints coexpressed by intratumoral CD4<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - FoxP3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells highly clonal, high inhibitory checkpoint expression
 - **perhaps other ICBs fail because they aren't inhibiting Tregs?**
# Immune dysfunction revealed by digital spatial profiling of immuno-oncology markers in progressive states of renal cell carcinoma and in brain metastases
 - lower immune checkpoint inhibitor (TIM-3, CTLA-4), cytolytic (GZMA, GZMB), and T cell activation (CD25) protein expression in metastases compared with primary tumors
 - metastases macrophages less M1-like, inflammatory markers (HLA-DR, CD127)
# Immune-related adverse events after immune checkpoint blockade-based therapy are associated with improved survival in advanced sarcomas
 - gene expression analyzes of baseline tumor samples: patients with irAEs had more tumor-infiltrating DCs, CD8 Ts, and Tregs, upregulation of immune/inflammatory pathways, so association between immune "hotness" of tumor and irAEs, **I wonder why TIL abundances would be related to irAEs, perhaps TIL abundances correlate with general PBMC/irAE-infiltrating lymphocyte abundances, or they say rather that irAE development is linked to pre-existing immune response (to tumor)**
# Immune-related adverse events and survival among patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - irAE development associated with improved anti-tumor response
# Immune-Related Adverse Events and Their Association With the Effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Real-World Study From China
 - see more antitumor response in irAE group compared to non-irAE group, irAE associated with progression-free survival but not with overall survival
# Immune-related adverse events as potential surrogates of immune checkpoint inhibitors' efficacy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized studies
 - **low strength correlation between ICI therapy effects and overall/specific irAE rates (< 1/3 of variability in anti-tumor response from ICI explained by variability in irAE incidence from ICI), seems less robust here than what I thought from other studies**
# Immune-related adverse events in checkpoint blockade: observations from human tissue and therapeutic considerations
 - dysregulated cytokines (IFNγ and TNF) in irAE tissue
 - high T cell infiltration in irAE tissue
 - **PD-1 blockade more CD8 effect, CD4 effect more for CTLA-4 blockade**
 - CD8<sup>+</sup>CXCR3<sup>+</sup> T cells elevated in gastrointestinal, dermatological, and musculoskeletal irAEs
# Immune-related adverse events in various organs caused by checkpoint inhibitors
## Abstract
 - PD-1 receptor on T and B cells, binds PD-L1/2 ligands
 - PD-L1 dominant role in Th1/17 immunity, PD-L2 works mainly in Th2 immunity
## Epidemiology of irAEs
 - irAEs common in skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, endocrine organs, lungs
 - irAEs more common with CTLA-4 blockade than PD-1 blockade
## Mechanisms of irAEs
 - some irAEs have immune counterparts (like thyroiditis and Hashimoto disease, gastrointestinal irAEs and IBD)
 - **irAEs progress more rapidly than autoimmune conditions, also transient often with quick recovery**
## The roles of CTLA-4
 - CTLA-4 expressed on activated T cells, some CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, **CTLA-4 blockade can interfere with T cell differentiation and eliminate Tregs peripherally and in TME**
## The roles of PD-1
 - PD-L1/2 expressed on APCs and in peripheral tissue (PD-L1 expression enhanced with activation stimuli like IFN-γ or IL-17A, PD-L2 mostly induced on APCs by IL-4, higher affinity for receptor than PD-L1)
 - **no antibodies for PD-L2, only PD-L1, in clinical use**
 - PD-L2 has stimulatory and inhibitory effects depending on context
## Differences between CTLA-4 and PD-1
 - **CTLA-4 and PD-1 signaling converge on Akt, regulator of T cell activation, via PI3K antagonization (CD28 activation promotes Akt phosphorylation via PI3K)**
## T cell reactivity in irAEs
 - **CTLA-4 blockade induces more diversified T cells (including autoreactive ones), PD-1 blockade induce more clonal TCR repertoire and proliferation of intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells**
 - **T cells seen infiltrating into irAE tissue, T cells seen targeting irAE tissue seen in blood, so T cells involved in irAEs**
## B cell reactivity in irAEs
 - **ICB induces reduction in circulating B cells, increase in CD21<sup>low</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> memory B cells and plasmablasts that precede and correlate with irAEs**
 - **autoantibodies present ~50% of time for irAEs**
# Immune-related adverse events (irAE) in cancer immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and survival outcomes correlation: to rechallenge or not?
 - no difference in outcome whether or not ICI resumed after irAE-related treatment interruption
# Immune-related adverse events of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors: a single center experience
 - patients who developed irAEs were younger
# Immune-Related Gene Expression Profiling After PD-1 Blockade in Non–Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Melanoma
 - most patients exhibit partial/complete resistance to PD-1 blockade
 - study patients with various cancers treated with PD-1 blockade
 - **identify 23 immune-related genes/signatures linked to response and progression-free survival**
 - **PD1 gene expression along with 12 signatures tracking CD8 and CD4 T cell activation, natural killer cells, and IFN activation associated significantly with non-progressive disease and progression free survival**
# Immune mediators as predictive biomarkers for anti-PD-1 antibody therapy in urothelial carcinoma
 - IL-6/8/12, sTNF-R1, IFNγ plasma levels can help predict prognosis and irAEs in ICI-treated patients
# Immune responses in checkpoint myocarditis across heart, blood, and tumor
## Abstract
 - presence of cardiac-expanded TCRs in a circulating, cycling CD8 T cell population as a novel peripheral biomarker of fatality
## Introduction
 - irAE myocarditis histology: heterogeneous lymphocyte infiltration into myocardium, both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
## Results
### Activated CD8 T cells and CD4 T cells are increased in irMyocarditis
### Immunosuppression alters T cell gene expression but not TCR repertoire in an irMyocarditis case with matched pre- and post-corticosteroid heart samples
### TCR clones enriched in irMyocarditis hearts are distinct from those enriched in tumor
 - across all irMyocarditis patients, five clones were enriched in both heart and tumor (18% of tumor-enriched TCR-βs, 26% of heart-enriched TCR-βs), but in each irMyocarditis patients, the TCR-β clones most expanded in heart tissue compared to control tissue were not enriched in the tumor relative to control tissue
 - **modest overlap of TCR β clones between heart and tumor but majority of enriched/most expanded clones in each tissue are distinct**
## Discussion
 - arguing against shared antigens between heart and tumor, cardiac protein α-myosin autoantigen in mouse models of irMyocarditis but healthy controls here have T cell clones reactive for this antigen in blood (also these were not most expanded clones in irMyocarditis tissue in cancer patients)
# Immune signatures of checkpoint inhibitor-induced autoimmunity - A focus on neurotoxicity
 - irAE patients had higher frequencies of CD8 TEM (type 1)/TCM cells
# Immune signatures predict development of autoimmune toxicity in patients with cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors
## Highlights
 - systemic immune signatures shortly after ICI start linked to irAEs
 - ICI treated patients with irAEs associated with expansion of Ki-67<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets
 - ICI treated patients with irAEs associated with IFN-γ and IFN-γ-related proteins CXCL9-11 increases
## Summary
 - early increase in CXCL9/CXCL10/CXCL11 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) 1 to 2 weeks after the start of therapy are likely indicators of heightened risk of developing irAEs
 - an early expansion of Ki-67<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells and Ki-67<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is also likely to be associated with increased risk of irAEs
## Results
### The presence of ICI-induced irAEs correlated with improved patient survival
 - irAEs more frequent in treatment responders in both melanoma and NSCLC
### A potential biomarker profile to predict the development of ICI-irAEs in patients with cancer
 - early treatment expansion of IFN-γ-driven cytokines and of Ki-67<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets provide good prediction model for irAE development (also increase in serum CXCL10), expansion of Ki-67<sup>+</sup> Tregs specifically for melanoma irAEs, CD8<sup>+</sup> Ki-67<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion specifically for NSCLC irAEs
 - IL-10 increase in early treatment associated with reduced irAE risk
## Discussion
 - **they also raise/cite the idea of antigen mimicry between tumor and self antigens, I think this is basically the same idea as the crossreactivity Peter mentioned perhaps underlying irAEs in 10/5/23 meeting (i.e. T cells crossreactive to tumor and self underlie irAEs)**
# Immune tolerance in liver disease
 - incomplete activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (proliferation but then clonal exhaustion or death of T cells)
 - poor CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation (liver APCs express inhibitory cytokines and co-inhibitory ligands)
 - myeloid cells mediate immunosuppression (Kupffer cells are myeloid-derived suppressor cells, promote Treg activation along with DCs)
# Immune tolerance: what is unique about the liver
 - liver continuously exposed to food and microbial antigens from intestine, barrier towards environmental antigens
 - liver also exposed to neoantigens from metabolism
 - risk of immune activation in liver higher than other organs due to these antigen exposures
 - therefore, liver has acquired mechanisms of immune tolerance to avoid overactive immune response
 - liver allografts are accepted across MHC mismatches without immunosuppression due to liver immune tolerance
 - non-liver allografts also rejected less with co-transplantation of liver allograft, **not sure how this induces systemic tolerance but very interesting**
# Immune toxicities elicited by CTLA-4 blockade in cancer patients are associated with early diversification of the T cell repertoire
## Abstract
 - CTLA-4 blockade leads to proliferation of circulating T cells, also clonal expansion of tissue-reactive T cells?
 - **CTLA-4 blockade induced greater diversification of T cell repertoire (more clonotypes including newly detected clones, decreased clonality) in irAE patients compared to no irAE patients**
 - initial broadening in repertoire occured within 2 weeks of treatment preceeding irAE onset
 - irAE patients had more diverse CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but no differences in Tregs
## Introduction
 - **prior work: CTLA-4 blockade promotes remodeling of T cell repertoire (gain and loss of clonotypes but an overall net bias towards gains leading to increased repertoire diversity)**
 - **survival not correlated with generation of new clones but rather with maintenance of pre-existing, high frequency (> 1 in 1,000) clonotypes**
 - **takehome: T cell diversification deleterious via promotion of autoreactivity**
 - **mechanistic model: CTLA-4 blockade induces autoreactivity by mobilizing newly detectable clones, irAE-mediating clones may be enriched within population of activated T cells, distinct from other tissue-specific immunopathologies driven by oligoclonal response to specific antigens like celiac**
## Discussion
 - **with how early TCR diversification is here compared to how late irAEs can develop, TCR repertoire changes can't be the only factor in irAE development**
# Immunogenic correlates of immune-related adverse events for anti-programmed cell death 1 therapy
## Abstract
 - 9,104 patients across 21 cancer types
 - DC abundance strongest correlator with irAE risk, followed by tumor mutational burden, also CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cell abundance
 - also see *IRF4*, *TCL1A* gene predictors
## Discussion
 - relationship between tumor mutational burden and irAE risk: increase in immunogenic neoantigens could resemble peptides in normal tissues (~crossreactivity hypothesis, more neoantigens = more possibly affected self-antigens)
 - perhaps DCs important as potent APC, critical for priming naive T cells, **deficient apoptosis of DCs may increase DC abundance and lead to autoimmunity**
 - **model: intratumoral DCs capture immunogenic neoantigens in tumor microenvironment, migrate to draining lymph nodes, disseminate neoantigens and stimulate resident T cells, educated T cells circulate systemically and induce neoantigen-specific immunopathologies i.e. irAEs against crossreacted self-antigens at distal sites**
# Immunogenicity of somatic mutations in human gastrointestinal cancers
 - tumor-infiltrating leukocytes from 9/10 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers contained CD4<sup>+</sup> and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recognizing 1-3 neo-epitopes from somatic mutations expressed in their own tumors
 - **takehome: surprisingly few neo-epitopes of cancer recognized by immune system, guessing that cancer has many more than 1-3 neo-epitopes, but perhaps I'm mistaken**
# Immunogenic variations predict immune-related adverse events for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
 - *MAPK* and *PTPRC* (*CD45*) variants may predict irAEs
 - *ARAD1* and *IL6* variants likely predict severe irAEs
# Immunomediated colitis induced by nivolumab that mimics endoscopically and histologically an ulcerative colitis
 - case report
# Immunosensitivity mediated by downregulated AKT1-SKP2 induces anti-PD-1-associated thyroid immune injury
 - although female hormones suspected to cause susceptibility to immune injury, dividing female patients by age (to look at pre/post menopausal females) didn't yield any differences
# Immunotherapy goes local: the central role of lymph nodes in driving tumor infiltration and efficacy
 - previous literature: ICB resistance related to lack of TILs, tumor-draining LN important for CTLA-4 blockade (perceived mechanism involving T cell priming here) but there's also evidence for tumor-draining LN being important for PD-1 blockade
# Immunotherapy in oncology and the kidneys: a clinical review of the evaluation and management of kidney immune-related adverse events
 - acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis is most common kidney irAE, glomerular lesions and electrolyte disturbances also seen
 - recommend early use of carticosteroids when appropriate
# Immunotherapy-mediated thyroid dysfunction: genetic risk and impact on outcomes with PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer
 - thyroid irAE associated with anti-tumor response
 - genetic risk for hypothyroidism associated with risk of developing thyroid irAEs
# Impact of aging on immune-related adverse events generated by anti-programmed death (ligand) PD-(L)1 therapies
 - older people get more irAEs, perhaps related to higher levels of autoantibodies in older people
# Improved survival with T cell clonotype stability after anti-CTLA-4 treatment in cancer patients
# Abstract
 - **CTLA-4 blockade results in both expansion and loss of T cell clonotypes, global turnover of T cell repertoire**
 - improved survival associated with maintenance of high-frequency clones at baseline
 - stably maintained clonotypes included T cells with high avidity TCRs, like virus-reactive T cells
## Discussion
 - 2 models of effects of CTLA-4 blockade on Teffs: (i) the threshold model whereby CTLA-4 blockade would allow low-avidity T cells to expand and diversity to increase, (ii) the attenuation model whereby CTLA-4 blockade would promote the preferential expansion of high-avidity T cells and narrowing of the repertoire
 - results not really cleanly supporting either model
 - **diverse repertoires are important in limiting the magnitude of immune escape but may also promote self-reactive clones and induce host inflammation**
# Improvement of PD-1 blockade efficacy and elimination of immune-related gastrointestinal adverse effect by mTOR inhibitor
 - ICB induces colitis in some melanoma patients, promotes infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells into colitic lesions
 - see PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activated in CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells of colitic lesions
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may already be present in healthy tissues, **perhaps why some tissues get more irAEs (more tissue resident immune cells in skin and colon?)**
 - alternative hypothesis: shared antigens between tumor and self, tumor infiltrating T cells leak into bloodstream and target self-antigens
# Improving CAR-T immunotherapy: overcoming the challenges of T cell exhaustion
 - **CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) allows modified T cells to mount antigen-specific immune response to cells bearing CAR target antigen independently of MHC**
 - CAR T cell therapy failure often attributed to antigen escape (selection pressure under CAR T surveillance leads to emergence of antigen-negative tumors), but relapse can occur with antigen-positive tumors (can be hard for CAR T cells to access tumor cells for example due to regulatory T cells in tumor secreting inhibitory cytokines)
 - both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can become exhausted
 - T cell inhibitory receptors: PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3, TIGIT, CTLA-4, but several of these inhibitory receptors are upregulated in T cell activation to modulate co-stimulatory signaling (**so inhibitory receptors alone aren't enough to distinguish between exhausted and activated T cells**)
 - targeting TGF-β signaling to help prevent exhaustion: TGF-β is highly expressed in tumor microenvironment and suppresses T cells
# Incidence and risk factors of immune-related adverse events induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors among older adults with non-small cell lung cancer
 - 8175 older NSCLC patients
 - 46.8% of patients had irAEs, pneumonitis (16.5%), hypothyroidism (10.5%), arrhythmia (11.18%), and acute kidney injury (5.8%) were the most common irAEs
 - median time to irAE was 82 days (IQR: 29-182 days)
 - hematologic irAEs present earlier, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, musculoskeletal irAEs present later
 - history of autoimmune disorder increases irAE risk
 - chemotherapy in combination with ICI increases irAE risk
# Incidence and severity of immune-related hepatitis after dual checkpoint therapy is linked to younger age independent of herpes virus immunity
 - **surprising given other literature showing increased irAE incidences in older patients**
# Incidence of Endocrine Dysfunction Following the Use of Different Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Regimens
 - high incidence of endocrine dysfunction (hypo/hyper-thyroidism) in patients receiving ICI (immune checkpoint inhibitor) regimens, higher with combination therapy
# Incidence of immune-related adverse events and its association with treatment outcomes: the MD Anderson Cancer Center experience
 - 34% of 290 patients had irAEs
 - severe irAEs associated with improved overall survival
# Increased circulating levels of CRP and IL-6 and decreased frequencies of T and B lymphocyte subsets are associated with immune-related adverse events during combination therapy with PD-1 inhibitors for liver cancer
 - irAE patients (especially those with severe irAEs) had higher levels of CRP and IL-6, lower levels of non-NK lymphocytes
# Induction of neoantigen-specific cytotoxic T cells and construction of T cell receptor co-engineered T cells for ovarian cancer
## Abstract
 - neoantigens implicated as major target of anticancer cytotoxic T cells
 - goal: engineer neoantigen-specific T cells, already able, pilot study to test efficacy here
 - methods to engineer neoantigen-specific TCR: predict neoantigen epitope, synthesize neoantigen peptide, identify neoantigen-specific TCR (hardest part, have to stimulate T cells with peptides), produce virus vector to express TCR
## Introduction
 - tumor regression often achieved by activated cytotoxic T cells targeting neoantigens (mostly generated by nonsynonymous mutations)
 - cytotoxic T cells targeting neoantigens enriched in TILs in patients responding well to TIL infusion therapy (TILs isolated from tumor, expanded, given back to patient)
## Discussion
 - melanoma has highest somatic mutation burden among human cancers (hundreds of neoantigens/patient, 12 mutations/Mb)
 - ovarian cancer has 1 mutation/Mb
 - avoidance of crossreactive T cells (engineering T cells to recognize neoantigen and not WT healthy tissue antigen): **position of amino acid substitution in neoantigen peptide matters as when mutation occurs at anchor position affinity of WT and mutant peptides to HLA are similar**
# Induction of T cell exhaustion by JAK1/3 inhibition in the treatment of alopecia areata
 - alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease caused by T cell-mediated destruction of the hair follicle
 - JAK1/3 inhibitors disrupt γc cytokine signaling (important for T cell development, activation, homeostasis), selectively induces T cell exhaustion to help treat this autoimmune disease
# Inhibition of IL-25/IL-17RA improves immune-related adverse events of checkpoint inhibitors and reveals antitumor activity
 - mouse model
 - prednisolone, anti IL-6, anti-TNFalpha, anti-IL-25 (IL-17E), and anti-IL-17RA all reduce irAEs in mice but only anti-IL25/17-RA also exert antitumor activity (and others actually add to tumor burden)
 - **mechanism: IL-25/IL-17RA blockade reduces organ-infiltrating lymphocyte numbers to reduce irAEs**
# Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs): cytokine hubs regulating immunity and tissue homeostasis
 - ILCs enriched at mucosal barriers, activated by stress signals and epithelial/myeloid-derived cytokines, respond by secreting effector cytokines to maintain survival and mucosal integrity
 - ILCs do not possess rearranged antigen-specific cell receptors (TCR/BCR) but they mirror T helper cell diversity regarding cytokine secretion and transcription factors regulating differentiation
 - ILCs express cytokine receptor γ chain with IL-7 receptor(R)α (CD127)
# Insight into immune profile associated with vitiligo onset and anti-tumoral response in melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy
## Abstract
 - **they usually find different TCR sequences in vitiligo and primary melanoma lesions, so T cell response against normal melanocytes leading to vitiligo is not usually mediated by reactivation of T cell clones infiltrating/specific to primary melanoma but rather perhaps by T cells targeting metastatic tissues, so kind of different from my thinking of usually crossreactivity between primary tumor and irAE site but could also be crossreactivity between metastases and irAE sites**
## Introduction
 - vitiligo irAE really better called a leukoderma lesion but very similar to spontaneous vitiligo (histology ~same)
## Results
### Patients who developed vitiligo during immunotherapy have a diverse frequency of circulating immune cells
 - 12 ICB responder patients
 - reduction of circulating CD8-mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT), T helper (Th)-17, and T-reg cells associated with vitiligo onset
 - reduction in natural killer (NK) CD56<sup>bright</sup> cell frequency was detected during treatment in both patient groups, suggesting an association with a positive clinical response
 - reduction in frequency of PD-1 expressing CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, Th1, Th1/17 cells in all patients, moreso for those not developing vitiligo
### T cells infiltrating immunotherapy-induced vitiligo share V(D)J rearrangements with T cells infiltrating metastasis lesions and primary melanomas
 - TRB CD3 sequencing on vitiligo biopsies, also do TCR-seq on PBMCs
 - **metastasis and vitiligo sample TCRs more similar than primary melanoma and vitiligo TCRs**
 - see shared TCR clonotypes betwen melanoma and metastasis
 - metastasis TCRs most diverse, followed by PBCMs, then vitiligo, then lastly primary tumor (most clonal TCRs)
## Discussion
 - vitiligo caused by oxidative stress of melanocytes (ROS release by stressed melanocytes), leading to innate immune activation (DCs recognize damage-associated molecules) which stimulates anti-melanocyte adaptive immunity (autoreactive T cells, enhanced by impaired Tregs)
 - TCRs generally different in vitiligo lesions and primary melanoma, **TCRs more often shared between vitiligo and metastases vs. vitiligo and primary tumor**
 - **"beneficial autoimmunity": shared TCRs recognizing tumor-associated antigens in vitiligo and metastatic lesions of positive responders**
# Integrated analysis of multimodal single cell data
 - weighted nearest neighbor analysis integrates multimodal single cell data in an unsupervised manner by learning relative utility of each data type in each cell
# Integrated cancer cell-specific single-cell RNA-seq datasets of immune checkpoint blockade-treated patients
 - compiled 8 scRNA-seq datasets from 9 cancer types, 174 patients, ~90k cancer cells, don't think they have TCRseq though...
# Integrated NY-ESO-1 antibody and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses correlate with clinical benefit in advanced melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab
 - isotype control: primary antibody that lacks specificity to target but matches class/type of primary antibody used, negative control to see non-specific background signal
 - CTLA-4 blockade improves survival in patients with advanced melanoma, also enhances immunity to NY-ESO-1 (cancer-testis antigen expressed in some melanoma patients)
 - see increase (16% to 22%) in seropositivity for NY-ESO-1 antibody after CTLA-4 blockade, seropositive individuals more likely to experience clinical benefit (seropositive individuals who didn't experience clinical benefit more likely didn't have associated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells)
# Integrated single-cell profiling dissects cell-state-specific enhancer landscapes of human tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - common chromatin trajectory underlies TIL dysfunction
 - molecular continuum from pre-T<sub>EX</sub> to terminally exhausted T cells (continuous increase in *CXCL13*, *TOX1/2*, inhibitory receptor activity)
# Integrative analysis of gut microbiome and host transcriptomes reveals associations between treatment outcomes and immunotherapy-induced colitis
 - DNA repair and cell cycle genes enriched in responders, innate immune response, NFAT, IFN‐γ signaling enriched in non-responders
 - association between GI irAE and ICI response
 - ICB response and GI irAE associated with *Enterobacteriaceae taxa*, tRNA metabolism, RNP complex biogenesis pathways in colon
# Integrative analysis of risk factors for immune-related adverse events of checkpoint blockade therapy in cancer
 - allelic variation of *HLA-B* correlated with irAE risk
# Interferon-gamma-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue resident memory T cells are a targetable hallmark of immune checkpoint inhibitor-colitis
 - **CD8 Trms (*IFNG* and inhibitor checkpoint-expressing) dominant activated T cell subset in ICI colitis, activation correlates with ICI colitis severity**
 - **activated CD8 Trms express high levels of checkpoint inhibitor, interferon-gamma transcripts**
 - similar between combination ICB and PD-1 blockade
# Interleukin-2 signaling in the regulation of T cell biology in autoimmunity and cancer
 - CD25 (IL-2Rα) heightens receptor affinity for IL-2
 - IL-2R signaling reinvigorates exhausted CD8s in response to ICB
# Interleukin-6 blockade abrogates immunotherapy toxicity and promotes tumor immunity
 - IL-6 expression, neutrophil and chemotactic markers higher in colitis than normal intestinal tissue
 - Th17 cells more prevalent than Th1 cells in irAE enterocolitis tissue
 - CTLA-4 blockade induced stronger Th17 memory in colitis than PD-1 blockade, tracks with CTLA-4 having more/worse irAEs
 - neutrophil recruitment via chemokines from Th17 cells associated with autoimmune diseases, so that tracks with irAE colitis here
# Interpreting T cell crossreactivity through structure: implications for TCR-based cancer immunotherapy
## Abstract
 - melanoma-specific T cells crossreacting with healthy heart/nervous tissue, crossreactivity
 - **crossreactivity driven by structural similarities of seemingly unrelated pMHCs (by sequence)**
 - **"hot-spots" for crossreactivity, some residues more important than others for allowing/triggering crossreactivity**
## Hypothesis and theory
 - **there are biases in somatic recombination process, so some TCRs are produced more often than others (leading to public TCRs)**
 - **it's uncommon for two different MHCs to be able to bind a given peptide, but crossreactivity involving different MHCs has been reported**
 - **MHC binding importance in TCR-pMHC interaction is one of causes of allogenic transplant rejection**
 - **TCR has flexible loops (including CDRs) that interact with pMHC**
 - **α CDRs usually bind N-terminus of peptide, β CDRs bind C-terminus**
 - **TCR footprint: general docking mode of TCR to cognate pMHC, germline bias i.e. TCR recognizes conserved MHC residues**
# Interesting possibilities to improve the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab (Yervoy)
 - target ICI to tumor with streptavidin-biotin technology (anti-tumor antibody conjugated to streptavidin and biotin-labeled anti-CTLA-4 antibody for example)
# Intestinal toxicity to CTLA-4 blockade driven by IL-6 and myeloid infiltration
 - mouse and human
 - microbiome dysbiosis as driving mechanism for irAEs
 - immune signature of CTLA-4 blockade-mediated irAEs: colonic neutrophil accumulation, systemic IL-6 release (IL-6 blockade can prevent irAEs perhaps), **this IL-6 being associated with (gut) irAEs I've read about elsewhere so it seems solid**
 - also see more Tregs in colitis
# Intratumoral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells mediate anti-tumor cytotoxicity in human bladder cancer
## Abstract
 - scRNAseq and paired TCRseq of 7 patients, bladder tumor and non-malignant tissue
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells similar in tumors and non-malignant tissue, but CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have tumor-specific states (including Tregs)
 - **find cytotoxic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expanded, can kill tumors in MHC class-II dependent fashion and are suppressed by Tregs**
## Results
### Tregs are clonally expanded in bladder tumors
 - CD4<sup>+</sup> TCR repertoire more restricted (less diverse) in TME (~11% unique clonotypes shared by > 1 cell) than in adjacent non-malignant tissue (~5% unique clonotypes shared by > 1 cell)
 - **restricted repertoire in TME due to expansion of Tregs**
## Discussion
 - origin of cytotoxic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells: doesn't seem to arise from Tregs (no clonotype sharing), perhaps from other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (shared clones)
# Intratumoral dendritic cell-CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell helper cell niches enable CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation following PD-1 blockade in hepatocellular carcinoma
## Abstract
 - ICB response correlated with clonal expansion of intratumoral CXCL13<sup>+</sup> CH25H<sup>+</sup> IL-21<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells and granzyme K<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> effector-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - terminally exhausted CD39<sup>high</sup> TOX<sup>high</sup> PD-1<sup>high</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells dominate in nonresponders
 - PD-1<sup>+</sup> TCF-1<sup>+</sup> (progenitor exhausted) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells shared clones mostly with effector-like cells in responders or terminally exhausted cells in nonresponders, so local CD8<sup>+</sup> differentiation induced by ICB
## Main
 - T cells can be in core of tumor (T cell rich) or in stroma (T cell excluded), or not in TME at all (T cell low)
# Intratumoral expression levels of *PD-L1*, *GZMA*, and *HLA-A* along with oligoclonal T cell expansion associate with response to nivolumab in metastatic melanoma
 - *PD-L2* expression levels also correlate with response to nivolumab
 - Th1 response dominance in responders (higher *TBX21/GATA3* ratio)
 - see oligoclonal T cell expansion in responders' TILs
# Intratumoral T cell receptor repertoire composition predicts overall survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
 - high intratumoral TCR diversity associated with survival, as was high T cell abundance in PBMCs
 - subset of TCRs predicts survival, more likely to be in CD8 TEM and CD4 Treg subsets perhaps recognizing beta islet-derived autoantigens...
# Intratumoral Tcf1<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with stem-like properties promote tumor control in response to vaccination and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy
 - mostly mouse
 - human (and mouse) tumors house ~undifferentiated Tcf1<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that have stem-like properties (expansion, regeneration, differentiation), differentiate into Tcf1<sup>-</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells upon ICB
# Inverse vaccination, the opposite of Jenner's concept, for therapy of autoimmunity
 - Jenner invented vaccination in 1796
 - autoimmunity treatment includes immunosuppression via anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (B cells marked by CD20), anti-CD52 mAb (WBCs marked by CD52), similarly reduce transplant rejection with mAbs against CD3 (T cells marked by CD3), can also disrupt lymphocyte ingress into tissue via integrin blockade or impeded egress of lymphocytes out of lymph nodes via spingosine phosphate receptor modulation
# Investigational biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor immune-related adverse event prediction and diagnosis
 - specific irAEs can be monitored with creatinine clearance, thyroid function tests, serum cortisol/adrenocorticotrophic hormone
 - history of autoimmune disease is only routinely used clinical parameter to predict irAE risk
 - different irAEs have different median onset times (myocarditis 34 days, dermatologic 25 days, hypothyroidism 73 days, hyperthyroidism 37 days, T1D 49 days, colitis 38 days, hepatitis 6-14 weeks, pneumonitis 3 months, nephritis 91 days, arthritis 3 months)
 - ICIs promote attack of self tissue: anti-CTLA-4 therapy disrupts peripheral negative selection (T cell surface CTLA-4 prevents costimulation and activation of novel self-reactive T cells), anti-PD-1 therapy alters epigenome of exhausted T cells, reactivating them and potentially leading to self-tissue attack, ICIs also deplete Tregs (so previously anergic self-reactive T cells can be activated and attack self-tissue)
 - antigen spread: immune-mediated tumor cell destruction leading to cell debris (otherwise hidden from immune detection) generating new tumor/self-reactive T cells
 - irAEs may result from direct antibody effects (pituitary CTLA-4 expression results in anti-CTLA-4 toxicity of pituitary dysfunction)
 - increased baseline levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, lower baseline Treg levels may increase colitis irAE risk
 - increased T cell diversity may increase irAE risk (increased expansion of > 55 CD8<sup>+</sup> clones)
 - HLA-DR4 associated with increased T1D irAE risk
# Is autoimmunity the Achilles' heel of cancer immunotherapy
 - hypophysitis most common endocrine irAE after CTLA-4 blockade, rarely observed with PD-1 blockade
# Lactate modulates RNA splicing to promote CTLA-4 expression in tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells
 - lactate uptake by Tregs contributes to efficacy of CTLA-4 blockade
 - RNA splicing machinery correlated with tumor-infiltrating Treg cell signatures
 - spliceosome component USP39 maintains Treg cell function via CTLA-4
 - lactate modulates Foxp3-dependent RNA-splicing-mediated CTLA-4 expression
# Landscape of stimulation-responsive chromatin across diverse human immune cells
 - previous literature: ~90% of GWAS hits for contributors to autoimmunity risk lie in non-coding regions (presumably act by altering gene regulation)
# Learning predictive signatures of HLA type from T-cell repertoires
 - trained model to predict HLA type based on TCR repertoire
 - different HLA types have different TCR repertoire features (CDR3 length, V gene usage...)
# Lineage tracing reveals clonal progenitors and long-term persistence of tumor-specific T cells during immune checkpoint blockade
## Abstract
 - scRNAseq + TCR-seq of tumor, normal, and lymph tissue in patients with lung cancer after ICI
 - cancer cells enriched for exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>regs</sub>, follicular CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells
 - the exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> tumor-specific T cells and follicular T helper cells were clonally linked to TCF7<sup>+</sup> SELL<sup>+</sup> progenitors in tumor draining lymph nodes
## Introduction
 - ICI can work via activation, expansion, and recruitment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from peripheral circulation
 - open questions: are there phenotypic differences between clonally related T cells in different anatomical sites? are progenitor exhausted T cells clonally linked to intratumoral exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells present in tumor-draining lymph nodes (seems to be the case in mice)? how long do tumor specific T cell clones like exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells persist after ICI?
## Results
### Clinical and pathological characteristics of lung cancer resections after ICB
### Multi-regional scRNA/TCR-seq of the T cell response to NSCLC
 - scRNA/TCR-seq on sorted CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - see minimal TCR overlap between 3 patients
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters contain larger clones than CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters
 - TCR repertoire most diverse in lymph node regions, greater clonal enrichment in tumor regions
### Exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and follicular helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are enriched in tumor regions with viable cancer cells
 - are certain specific T cell phenotypes enriched in regions containing viable tumor cells?
 - see lymph nodes enriched for naive and TCF1 CD8 T cells, adjacent normal regions enriched for effector CD8 T cells
 - exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters enriched in tumor regions
 - enriched naive, Treg, and follicular helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in lymph nodes, effector CD4 T cells enriched in adjacent normal regions, CD4 Tregs and follicular helper T cells enriched in tumor
# Lipidomics reveals immune-related adverse events in NSCLC patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor
 - not sure of significance of some lipid metabolites predicting irAE..., **perhaps relation is via signal transduction/membrane remodeling**
# Liver mediated adaptive immune tolerance
 - liver is immunologically tolerant, equipped to limit hypersensitivity to food-derived antigens, bacterial products, can easily accept allografts
 - persistent infection of liver with pathogen usually results in tolerance
 - immunosuppressive environment of liver makes adaptive immune cells of liver readily tolerogenic, promoting death of effector cells (also anergy, senescence, exhaustion) and "education" of regulatory cells
 - tolerance mechanisms of liver related to many liver diseases
 - liver is the largest organ with a rich blood supply (hepatic artery, portal vein), exposed to many microbial products, harmless food-derived antigens via intestines
# Linkage disequilibrium - understanding the evolutionary past and mapping the medical future
 - linkage disequilibrium: nonranom association of alleles of different loci
# Linking T cell receptor sequence to functional phenotype at the single cell level
 - different T cells bearing the same TCR can be functionally distinct
 - methods
# Location, location, location: tissue resident memory T cells in mice and humans
 - Trm markers: CD69 +/- CD103, many accessory markers (CD101, CD49a, PD-1, CXCR6, CLA, CCR8)
# Low-dose ipilimumab plus nivolumab combined with IL-2 and hyperthermia in cancer patients with advanced disease: exploratory findings of a case series of 131 stage IV cancers - a retrospective study of a single institution
 - hypothesis: reduce irAEs with hyperthermia to increase numbers of effector lymphocytes
 - irAEs similar to an auto-graft vs. host disease reactions following allogenic bone marrow transplantation
 - perhaps try lower dose of ICIs
# Lower frequencies of circulating suppressive regulatory T cells and higher frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells at baseline are associated with severe immune-related adverse events in immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated melanoma
 - severe irAE patients had higher frequencies of CD4 naive T cells, lower frequencies of CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells at all time points, lower frequencies of TIGIT<sup>+</sup> Tregs at baseline, higher frequencies of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4 TCMs and CD39<sup>+</sup> HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD8 TCMs at peak irAE time
# Low TCR binding strength results in increased progenitor-like CD8<sup>+</sup> tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
 - TILs with low TCR affinity to tumor-associated antigen had progenitor-like phenotypes and increased quiescence, higher affinity TCR TILs had more cell division and faster progression to T-cell exhaustion programs
# m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA methylation controls T cell homeostatis by targeting IL-7/STAT5/SOCS pathway
 - m<sup>6</sup>A is the most common and abundant mRNA modification
 - KO of m<sup>6</sup>A writer protein METTL3 in mouse T cells disrupts T cell homeostasis and differentiation
# Machine learning analysis of the T cell receptor repertoire identifies sequence features of self-reactivity
 - train model on mice data
 - TRBs
 - CD5 surface expression correlates with strength of self-pMHC signal
 - CD5<sup>low</sup> (less self-reactive?) TRB CDR3s longer and more acidic, CD5<sup>high</sup> (more self-reactive?) TRB CDR3s shorter and more hydrophobic
 - experimentally confirm predictions
# Machine learning predictions of MHC-II specificities reveal alternative binding mode of class II epitopes
 - dataset of 627,013 unique MHC-II ligands identified by mass spectrometry
 - determine binding motifs of 88 MHC-II alleles across species
 - widespread reverse-binding mode in HLA-DP ligands
 - machine-learning framework to predict binding specificities/ligands of any MHC-II allele
# Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II proteins: conformational plasticity in antigen presentation
 - APC presented peptides are generated from proteins produced by cell's own translational machinery or from proteins funneled into endo-lysosomal vesicular system
 - peptide repertoire presented by MHC proteins largely depends on structural features of binding groove of each particular MHC allelic variant
 - tapasin (for class I) and HLA-DM (for class II) are peptide editors that contribute to shaping of presented peptidome by favoring binding of high-affinity antigens
 - some MHC allelic variants are more susceptible to peptide editing than others, not well understood
 - peptide-MHC class I complexes are presented on all nucleated cells and are recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - pMHCII presentation by APCs (DCs, macrophages, B cells) activates CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, leading to coordination and regulation of effector cells
 - MHC binding platform composed of 2 domains from single heavy α-chain (HC) for MHCI and from two chains for MHCII (α-chain and β-chain), 2 domains form β-sheet as base and 2 α-helices on top that have space between them to accommodate a peptide chain
 - 2 membrane-proximal immunoglobulin domains support peptide-binding unit
 - MHCI binding groove can accomodate ~8-10 residue peptide, ~13-25 residue peptide for MHCII
# Measuring CDR3 length variability in individuals during ontogeny
 - *Xenopus laevis* analysis of Ig CDR3s
 - adult CDR3s longer
# Mechanisms and biomarkers of immune-related adverse events in gastric cancer
 - blocking CTLA-4 can induce activation of autoreactive T ells via depletion of Tregs (express CTLA-4), stimulation of B cells to produce autoantibodies
 - blocking CTLA-4/PD-1 may lead to expansion and activation of pre-existing tissue-resident memory T cells
 - irAE biomarkers in gastric cancer: HLA-DR15 (higher with irAEs, perhaps via IL-17), neutrophil/platelet to lymphocyte ratios (NLR, PLR, inflammatory markers of poor prognosis and irAE development)
 - managing irAEs: corticosteroids/immunosuppression
# Mechanisms of immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated colitis
 - autoimmunity from CTLA-4 deficiency likely attributable to CTLA-4 expression normally on Tregs
 - **doesn't seem like CTLA-4 blockade depletes Tregs but rather decreases their effectiveness (unable to antagonize CD80, unable to inhibit CD4 T proliferation)**
 - **CTLA-4 blockade leads to more naive T cell priming, consistent with more irAEs**
# Mechanisms of immune-related adverse events during the treatment of cancer with immune checkpoint inhibitors
## Abstract
 - mechanisms leading to irAEs are likely similar to those promoting anti-tumor responses (expansion of T cell repertoire)
 - **ICB can affect B cell responses and induce autoantibody production**
## Introduction
### Checkpoint inhibitors
 - CTLA-4 blockade leads to more irAEs than anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1
 - irAEs may depend on age (older patients perhaps more at risk due to age-related immune changes), sex, pre-existing autoimmune disease, prior anti-cancer treatment, and microbiome composition
 - irAE occurence likely associated with improved tumor response
### The mechanisms of ICIs
 - T cell activation requires TCR recognition of antigen and co-stimulation (CD28 from T cell interacting with CD80/86 on APCs)
 - both B cells and tumor cells may express PD-L1
 - **CTLA-4 (~30% homologous with CD28) expression induced on T cells following their activation (CTLA-4 also expressed on Tregs)**, CTLA-4 outcompetes CD28 for CD80/86 and the **CTLA-4-CD80/86 interaction decreases T cell-mediated immune responses by reducing IL-2 and IL-2 receptor expression**
 - anti-CTLA-4 antibodies can eliminate Tregs in tumor microenvironment via Fc-receptor-mediated interactions, **not sure what this is**
 - **activation of peripheral T cells and B cells induces PD-1 expression to maintain peripheral tolerance**
 - PD-L1 (on resting B cells, T cells, macrophages, DCs) and PD-L2 (sometimes on resting immune cells, induced by proinflammatory cytokines) are PD-1 ligands
 - CTLA-4/PD-1 signaling converge on Akt (regulates metabolism, apoptosis, proliferation); PD-1 signaling antagonizes PI3K directly while CTLA-4's effects occur via PP2A phosphatase
 - **anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies called "immune enhancers" and "immune normalizers" (normalizing T cell immunity in tumor microenvironment), respectively, consistent with PD-1 blockade having less irAEs**
### Mechanisms of T cell reactivity in irAEs
 - CTLA-4 blockade can lead to higher TCR V-β CDR3 diversity in patients with irAEs, doesn't seem to matter though for clinical response, **which may suggest distinct autoreactive and anti-tumor populations**
 - **irAEs may arise from mobilization of large numbers of T cells, some of which are autoreactive**
 - lag time between early changes in T cell populations upon ICI and development of irAEs later, perhaps **pathogenic T cells gradually emerge from larger number of clonotypes that occur after ICI**
### Mechanisms of B cell reactivity in irAEs
 - advanced melanoma patients receiving combination ICI had decreased circulating B cell counts, increased CXCL13 (germinal center activation marker) plasma levels, increased B cell clonality (in terms of immunoglobulin gene expression), and increased plasmablasts after treatment, and early changes in B cells correlated with higher rates of severe irAEs
 - subset of CD21<sup>low</sup> memory B cells particularly affected by combination ICI with restricted PD-1 expression and increased IFN-γ signaling after treatment
### Pre-existing autoimmune disease and immune checkpoint therapy
 - ICIs can flare underlying autoimmune disease
### Immunosuppression and tumor response
 - **lower response rate to anti-PD-1 therapy if on immunosuppressive therapy at treatment onset (i.e. for pre-existing autoimmune disease)**
# Mechanisms of T cell exhaustion guiding next generation immunotherapy
 - resting exhausted T cells in antigen-free environments doesn't reinvigorate them (exhaustion is a committed cell fate)
 - exhausted T cells, unlike functional memory T cells, do not exhibit antigen-independent homeostatic proliferation (self-renewal in presence of homeostatic cytokines IL-7, IL-15); exhausted T cells require antigen exposure for maintenance
 - key transcription factors involved in T cell exhaustion include BATF, IRF4, c-Jun (**c-Jun OE prevents exhaustion**), NR4A, **EOMES (I see this pop up often in papers**), TOX, and NFATC1
 - ICI is most effective when applied when antigen-specific T cells are not yet exhausted, **here, they say that ICI doesn't reprogram T cells away from exhausted state, although I feel like I've seen papers that say it does, perhaps before they are committed to exhaustion they can be recovered with ICI?**
 - exhausted fate exhibits a unique epigenetic profile, DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A adds repressive DNA methyl marks (DNMT3A KO T CD8 T cells maintain ability to respond to ICI despite chronic antigen exposure); SUV39H1, LSD1, and TET2 are other critical epigenetic regulators of T cell fate
 - path to exhaustion is a continuum, some precursor exhausted T cells can self-renew, TCF1<sup>+</sup> (express TCF7)
 - most CAR T cell protocols use a heterogeneous starting population of bulk CD4 and CD8 T cells spanning developmental potential range, but more plastic memory T cells (T<sub>cm</sub> i.e. central memory T cells and T<sub>scm</sub> i.e. stem cell memory T cells) possess greater effector/proliferative capacities and better eradicate tumors when used as CAR T cell starting populations
 - patients eligible for CAR T cell therapy usually have relapsed/refractory (treatment-resistant), so their T cells have likely been chronically antigen exposed, as well as exposed to chemotherapy (skews T cells towards more terminally differentiated effector memory i.e. T<sub>em</sub> cells), and this all makes the CAR T therapy less effective (than if it had been used at the beginning)
# Melanoma patients with immune-related adverse events after immune checkpoint inhibitors are characterized by a distinct immunological phenotype of circulating T cells and M-MDSCs
 - M-MDSCs: monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells
 - 31 melanoma patients
 - longitudinal study, peripheral blood samples before ICI, during ICI, at time of irAE, and during immunosuppression for irAE treatment
 - irAEs associated with improved survival, as seen elsewhere
 - **irAE patients had upregulated CD69 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, fewer Tregs**
 - patients treated with immunosuppression show more M-MDSCs
# Memory T cells: strategies for optimizing tumor immunotherapy
 - Tscm/Tcm show superior persistance and antitumor immunity compared to Tem and Teff cells
 - naive T cells in hyporesponsive state (small size, low proliferation, low metabolism)
 - TCMs in lymphoid organs and do not have immediate lytic function, TEMs in nonlymphoid tissues and have lytic activity and higher levels of receptors for migration to inflamed tissues
# MHC-II alleles shape the CDR3 repertoires of conventional and regulatory naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - **H2-A<sup>j</sup> favors selection of narrower and more hydrophobic CDR3 repertoire compared to H2-A<sup>b</sub> in mice**
# MHC class II (DRB) promoter polymorphism and its role in parasite control among malaria patients
# MHC class II tetramers
 - can interrogate CD4 T cells using soluble MHC II tetramers
### Tetramer assay/stain
 - use tetrameric MHCs to detect and quantify T cells specific for given antigen within sample
 - tetramer = 4 MHCs that present a specific peptide
 - use to find T cells with receptors that match that peptide
 - tetramers labeled with fluorophore, tetramer-bound T cells analyzed by flow cytometry
 - use tetramers as monomers don't have high enough affinity (MHC tetramer can bind more than 1 receptor on target T cell, increasing binding strength)
#### CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - CD8 coreceptors bind MHC class I molecules
 - most cells express MHC class I, process intracellular antigens and present them
 - class I MHC made of polymorphic α heavy chain and invariant light β 2 microglobulin
#### CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - CD4 coreceptors bind class II MHC molecules
 - class II MHC molecules expressed by APCs like DCs, macrophages
# Microbial metabolite enhances immunotherapy efficacy by modulating T cell stemness in pan-cancer
 - *L. johnsonii* enhances ICB via CD8s, cooperates with *C. sporogenes* to produce IPA (indole-3-propionic acid) which activates progenitor exhausted CD8s (H3K27 acetlyation increase at superenhancer of *Tcf7*)
# Mismatch repair deficiency is not sufficient to elicit tumor immunogenicity
## Abstract
 - DNA mismatch repair deficiency is associated with high tumor mutational burden and ICB sensitivity, but most mismatch repair deficient tumors are not responsive to ICB
 - intratumor mutational heterogeneity impedes T cell infiltration and ICB response
## Main
 - intratumor mutational heterogeneity refers to the fraction of mutations that are subclonal (only present in a minority of tumor cells), **so i.e. with a very mutationally heterogeneous tumor maybe there's a good immune response against a portion of the tumor but there's many other subclones that are not recognized by the immune system, i.e. subclones could be deleted with minimal impact on tumor fitness**
# Mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability-high as a predictor for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy efficacy
 - microsatellite instability-high follows mismatch repair deficiency
 - mismatch repair deficiency represents a good prognosis in early colorectal cancer but a poor prognosis in patients with metastasis (**perhaps because it's more easily recognized by immune system but it's a double edged sword as it's also likely more cancerous and dangerous at metastasis stage**)
# Mismatch repair deficiency predicts response of solid tumors to PD-1 blockade
 - cancers deficient in mismatch repair (MMR) have high mutation burden, seems to be a good predictor of response to PD-1 blockade
 - **many mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair-deficient cancers makes them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of cancer's tissue of origin**
 - show that ICI induces peripheral expansion of tumor-specific T cells and that mismatch repair-deficient tumors harbor functional MANA (mutation-associated neoantigens) specific T cells
 - TCR-seq works by CDR3 sequencing (most variable region of TCRα and β chains, governs interactions with peptide-MHC complexes, junction between V and J or D and J genes)
# Models for antigen receptor gene rearrangement: CDR3 length
 - CDR3 length distributions normal-like
 - specific biases likely govern rearrangement process (relatively narrow set of parameters creates observed shape of CDR3 length distribution)
# Molecular mechanisms of cutaneous immune-related adverse events (irAEs) induced by immune checkpoint blockade
## The biological function of immune checkpoints
### CTLA-4
 - CD28 homolog (with higher affinity for ligands than CD28) mostly expressed by activated T cells, constitutively expressed on Tregs
 - CTLA-4 ligands CD80/86 mostly on APCs
 - attenuates T cell activation to reduce immune responses to weak antigens (like self/tumor)
 - CTLA-4 expression in Tregs downregulates immune responses to maintain self-tolerance by inhibiting effector T cell proliferation and cytokine release
### PD-1
 - CD279, expressed by activated T cells, B cells, NKs, some myeloid cells
 - contributes to peripheral tolerance by binding ligands PD-L1 (CD274, B7-H1) or PD-L2 (CD273, B7-DC) on APCs (macrophages, DCs, some B cells)
 - PD-L1 expression induced in APCs by interferon and IL-17, PD-L2 expression stimulated by IL-4
### LAG-3
 - CD223
 - expressed by activated T cells, NKs, Tregs, B cells, DCs
 - **MHC II is primary LAG-3 ligand, higher affinity between LAG-3:MHC II than CD4:MHC II, so LAG-3 may downregulate T cell function by competing with CD4**
## Subtypes and possible mechanisms of cutaneous immune-related adverse events
 - type IV hypersensitivity reactions
 - genetic differences in HLA variants
 - increased proinflammatory cytokines
 - **autoreactive cytotoxic T cells against common antigens**, specifically for vitiligo-like depigmentation, Lichenoid eruption, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis
 - innate immunity
 - Th17 pathway activation
 - T cell (in)dependent humoral immunity
# Molecular mimicry and autoimmunity
## Highlights & abstract
 - molecular mimicry occurs when similarities between foreign and self-peptides leads to activation of autoreactive leukocytes by foreign antigens, can be deleterious or may help induce immune tolerance, **how?**
 - other mechanisms for autoimmunity besides molecular mimicry: breach in central tolerance, non-specific bystander activation, persistent antigenic stimuli
## Molecular mimicry and autoimmune diseases
 - criteria for molecular mimicry: similarity between self and foreign epitopes, antibodies or T cells that crossreact with both epitopes (foreign and self), link between exposure to foreign antigen and development of autoimmune disease, reproducibility of autoimmunity in animal model following sensitization with foreign epitopes
 - types of molecular mimicry: complete identity sharing at protein level, homology at protein level, common/similar amino acid sequences/epitopes, structural similarities
## Molecular mimicry and cross-reactivity: what is necessary?
 - cross-reactivity was at first expected to be low, but **only a small portion of an antigen is needed to be recognized by a TCR (8-10 amino acids for MHCI, 14-18 for MHCII, does this mean that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells might be more cross-reactive?**)
 - TCRs have specificity for MHC bearing peptide (MHC restriction)
 - there are anchor residues (critical residues of peptide required to bind specific MHC), but there are plastic residues as well, leading to polyspecificity
 - **chimera TCRs with 2 β or 2 α (and 1 of the other) could also lead to cross-reactivity with different specificities (perhaps different α-β pairs on same T cell have different specificities)**
# Molecular mimicry between tumor associated antigens and microbiota-derived epitopes
 - three cases of 100% homology between tumor associated antigens and microbiota-derived antigens of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla (> 90% of gut microbiota)
 - likely induction of crossreactive T CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, so anti-microbiota T cell memory could serve as anti-cancer T cell memory
 - **biological significance may depend on when individuals encounter microbiota species with antigens similar to tumor: early in life would mean that immune system could recognize antigens as self and that specific T cell clones would be removed (as tumor presenting homologous TAA would have an advantage), but if microbiota colonizes gut later in life the immune system could recognize peptide as non-self and then tumor would be exposed to specific memory T cells**
# Molecular pathways of colon inflammation induced by cancer immunotherapy
 - CD8 T cells underlie colitis irAEs, substantial fraction of colitis-associated CD8 T cels originate from Trm populations explaining the frequent early onset of colitis symptoms following ICB
 - **n = 8 (melanoma ICB colitis), n = 8 (HC), n = 6 (melanoma ICB no irAE), looks like a good dataset! TCR and RNA!**
# Molecular signatures of antitumor neoantigen-reactive T cells from metastatic human cancers
 - neoantigen-specific TILs exhibited tumor-specific expansion with dysfunctional phenotypes, distinct from blood-emigrant bystanders and regulatory TILs
 - neoantigen-specific TILs largely exhibited tumor-specific clonal expansion, with only limited overlap with dually expanded TILs found in the peripheral blood, possible caveat to any PBMC-based TCR feature analysis is that we don't know if they are tumor-specific or not, although here this is just neoantigen, so perhaps there is more sharing betweeen PBMC and TILs targeting tumor-associated antigens
# Moving towards personalized treatments of immune-related adverse events
 - corticosteroids are the cornerstone of irAE treatment, potent suppressors of T cell function/activity, followed by mycophenolate for patients for whom corticosteroids fail (this drug depletes guanosine nucleotides preferentially in T/B cells to inhibit their proliferation to suppress cell-mediated immune responses and antibody production), calcineurin inhibitors and methotrexate can also inhibit T cell function to treat irAEs, as can blocking of integrins T cells use to extravasate from circulation into peripheral tissue where they cause inflammation (like antibodies targeting alpha 4 beta 7 and alpha 4 integrins to treat colitis and encephalitis as these integrins are expressed on gut epithelium and blood-brain barrier, respectively)
 - histopathological findings of different organ irAEs: generally infiltrates into irAE tissue are lymphocyte rich, sometimes myeloid too (pulmonary)
# mTOR regulates T cell exhaustion and PD-1-targeted immunotherapy response during chronic viral infection
 - background: PD-1-blockade enhances T cell response by promoting differentiation of stem-like T cells towards TIM3<sup>+</sup> cells
 - results: blocking mTOR during T cell expansion enhances T cell response (stem-like T cells accumulate), but blocking mTOR after exhaustion has progressed causes immunosuppression (decreased TIM3<sup>+</sup> cells, increased viral load)
# Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are activated in the gastrointestinal tissue of patients with combination ipilumumab and nivolumab therapy-related colitis in a pathology distinct from ulcerative colitis
 - irAE colitis: see activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and (granzyme B<sup>+</sup>) MAITs, not seen in ulcerative colitis
 - ICB induces increase in peripheral activated memory CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells regardless of colitis irAE
 - low baseline circulating MAITs associated with irAE colitis
# Multi-omics prediction of immune-related adverse events during checkpoint immunotherapy
## Introduction
 - pneumonitis is the most common fatal irAE (10% death rate), myocarditis is the most lethal irAE (~50% mortality)
 - TCR diversity, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clonal expansion, tumor mutational burden predict irAEs
## Discussion
 - *LCP1* and *ADPGK* are genes related to T cell activation that predict irAEs
# Multiple environmental antigens may trigger autoimmunity in psoriasis through T cell receptor polyspecificity
 - psoriasis: T cell mediated autoimmune disease, *HLA-C06:02* is main risk gene (mediates autoimmune response against ADAMTSL5 autoepitope in melanocytes)
 - identify peptides from wheat, yeast, microbes, tobacco, pathogens that activate psoriasis-associated TCRs
# Multiple instance learning to predict immune checkpoint blockade efficacy using neoantigen candidates
 - predict ICB efficacy using neoantigen features (machine learning) to improve general imperfect prediction of ICB response from neoantigen load
 - SNV-derived neoantigens better predictor perhaps, not those from fusion genes, also those from indels seems to predict ICB response perhaps
# Multiple rearrangements in T cell receptor α chain genes maximize the production of useful thymocytes
 - allelic exclusion conventional for TCR β
 - TCR α expression less strictly regulated, endogenous TCR α chains often found in association with transgenic TCR β chains in transgenic mice
 - TCR α may make multiple rearrangements on each chromosome
# Multisystem immune-related adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer
 - multisystem irAEs associated with improved survival from ICIs in NSCLC (adjusting for treatment duration)
# Myocarditis in Cynomolgus monkeys following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - **increased proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells, increased in activated T cells and TCMs in blood, spleen, lymph nodes**
# Negative binomial additive model for RNA-Seq data analysis
## Methods for differential expression analysis
 - DESeq2, edgeR (based on negative binomial regression to model gene counts)
 - voom (based on empirical Bayes model)
 - BBSeq, based on β-binomial regression model
# Neoantigens: promising targets for cancer therapy
## Abstract
 - neoantigens come from mutations, dysregulated RNA splicing, disordered PTMs, and integrated viral ORFs (in the cases of viral cancers like HPV and EBV, called oncoviral antigens)
## Introduction
 - tumor vaccines can be used to improve antigen presentation
 - tumor associated antigens exhibit abnormal expression in tumors, limited expression in normal tissue (like overexpressed proteins, lineage-specific differentiation markers), but as these tumor associated antigens are non-mutated self-antigens central tolerance mechanisms may prevent effective immune responses
## The source of neoantigens
 - MHC-I presentation pathway: intracellular cytosolic (neo)antigens are processed in proteasome, transported into ER (via TAP), loaded onto MHC in ER, then pMHC complexes are transported to cell surface in vesicles
 - MHC-II presentation pathway: extracellular (neo)antigens are endocytosed, processed in endosome, loaded onto MHC in endosome, then pMHC complexes are transported to cell surface in vesicles
# Neoantigen quality predicts immunoediting in survivors of pancreatic cancer
 - **cancer immunoediting: hallmark of cancer, lymphocytes kill more immunogenic cancer cells causing less immunogenic clones to dominate population, proven in mice but unclear if occuring in humans**
 - methods: study 70 pancreatic cancer patients over 10 years
 - results: rare long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer who have stronger T cell activity in primary tumors develop genetically less heterogeneous recurrent tumors with fewer immunogenic mutations (neoantigens) despite having more time to accumulate mutations
 - neoantigen high immunogenicity (i.e. quality) inference: non-selfness (different from known antigens) and selfness (still able to bind MHC and activate T cell), so high quality/immunogenicity neoantigens are distinct from known antigens but still similar enough to bind MHC and activate T cells
 - long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer develop recurrent tumors with fewer high-quality neoantigens (natural immunoediting of neoantigens)
# Neoantigen specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in human melanoma have diverse differentiation states and correlate with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell, macrophage, and B cell function
 - CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that recognize neoantigens express *CXCL13* and are subdivided into clusters expressing memory and T follicular helper markers, cytolytic markers, inhibitory receptors, and IFN-γ
# Network-based machine learning approach to predict immunotherapy response in cancer patients
 - tumor mutation burden improves model
# Networks of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response activation in melanoma and vitiligo
 - vitiligo caused by destruction of melanocytes (by CD8 T cells)
 - melanocyte/melanoma shared antigens (MSAs) like Melan-A, tyrosinase, premalanosome (PMEL) are targets of vitiligo/anti-melanoma immune responses
 - ICIs more effective in "hot" tumors (with better immune infiltration)
 - **T cell infiltration into tumors can be driven by DCs recognizing tumor-derived DNA (cGAS-STING pathway), leading to IFN production, migration to tumor-draining LN , where DCs prime T cells and promote their migration to tumor via CXCL10, DCs also recruited to tumor by NKs (produce FLT3L, CCL5, XCL1)**
 - **melanoma most likely to respond to PD-1 blockade is one expressing PD-L1 and with TILs**
 - relapse after response to PD-1 blockade can result from LoF mutations of IFN-γ and antigen presentation pathway genes
 - **vitiligo typically recurs (in relapse) at same location, so memory T cells persist in skin and can be reactivated**
# Neurologic autoimmunity and immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - mostly pre-ICI predictors studied here
# New biomarkers exploration and nomogram construction of prognostic and immune-related adverse events of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors
## Abstract
 - CD3<sup>+</sup> CD56<sup>+</sup> CD16<sup>+</sup> NKT-like cells correlated with progression free survival and severe irAE development in NSCLC patients receiving ICI
 - also see higher CD4<sup>+</sup>:CD8<sup>+</sup> ratio associated with severe irAEs
## Discussion
 - PD-L1 expression is the most heavily studied biomarker, problematic due to spatial heterogeneity in expression
# New epigenetic regulators of T cell exhaustion
 - summary of Belk et al.'s *in vitro* CRISPR screen (chronic antigen stimulation model using antibody agonist for TCR over 10 days) to identify genes that regulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion
 - epigenetic modulating genes related to T cell exhaustion
 - eliminating *Arid1a* (chromatin modifier) allows CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to retain proliferative and cytotoxic functions *in vivo*
 - **this summary does state that ICI restores some functions of exhausted T cells, so again I'm not sure if ICI can reprogram exhausted T cells or not, likely depends on how terminally committed they are to exhaustion**
# Nivolumab in resected and unresectable metastatic melanoma: characteristics of immune-related adverse events and association with outcomes
 - irAEs in 68% of patients (mostly not severe)
 - **difference in overall survival between those with and without irAEs, irAEs incidence correlate with increase overall survival**
# Nivolumab receptor occupancy on effector regulatory T cells predicts clinical benefit
 - previous literature: high PD-1 expression on Teffs and low PD-1 expression on Tregs associated with clinical benefit from PD-1 blockade, **PD-1 blockade can suppress antitumor activity if Tregs activated, more likely with higher PD-1 expression on Tregs**
 - PD-1 receptor occupancy lower on eTregs in patients with clinical benefit, negative association between PD-1 occupancy on eTregs and mortality
 - baseline CD4 TCMs higher in those who go on to develop irAEs
 - PD-1 positivity in T cell subsets not associated with irAE development
 - slightly lower PD-1 occupancy on eTregs in irAE patients (not significant)
# NK-cell exhaustion, B-cell exhaustion, and T cell exhaustion - the differences and similarities
 - exhaustion is not the same as anergy (senescence and suppression)
 - exhaustion: impaired state, progressive loss of functionalities, reduced proliferative capacity, triggered by chronic antigen stimulation (chronic infection, cancer)
 - anergy: also an impaired state but from inadequate activating receptor stimualtion, hyporesponsiveness, no proliferation, defective production of major growth factors/inflammatory cytokines following antigen encounter
 - senescence: also an impaired state but from aging, permanent G1 arrest, restricts life span of cells to control replication, results from oncogene activation, telomere degradation, epigenetic changes, ionizing radiation; senescent cells remain viable, often secrete proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases (proteinases) in a state called SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype)
 - suppression: also an impaired state but from inhibition by non-antigenic factors, dysfunction caused by hypoxia, neuroendocrine activation (cortisol, glucocorticoids), hypercoagulable blood state (increased tissue factor, fibrin, thrombin, platelet activation), pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (E2), anti-inflammatory phase factors (IL-6, Il-10), transforming growth factor (TGF) β1, T<sub>regs</sub>
 - NKs are part of the innate immune system but are similar to cytotoxic T cells, they lack antigen specificity and are usually short-lived (< 10 days), so their exhaustion is likely less important
 - there are long-lived, somewhat antigen-specific NKs with memory recall though
 - B cell exhaustion: weaker antibody response (inhibited normal function)
# Ocular adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, a scoping review
 - they suggest irAEs can be broken into 2 categories: true irAEs (T cells activated against tumor and normal cells, theoretically this wanes after ICBs are stopped) and induction/exacerbation of paraneoplastic syndromes triggered by ICB (remote effects of cancer not caused by tumor/metastases, like immune response against tumor with cross-reaction of antibodies between tumor and self), **I don't really understand the difference between these two types here**
# On the specificity of protein-protein interactions in the context of disorder
 - **trying to find evidence for relation between hydrophobicity and cross-reactivity: bring up idea of transcriptional (co)activators being non-specific due to hydrophobicity, and negative charge (perhaps unhelpful with negatively charged DNA)**
# Outcome and treatment-related adverse events of combined immune checkpoint inhibition with flipped dosing in a real-world cohort of 79 patients with metastasized melanoma
 - changing dosages to minimize irAEs while keeping anti-tumor response
# Overcoming cold tumors: a combination strategy of immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - cold tumors escape immune response via lacking tumor antigens, presenting antigens poorly, preventing T cell infiltration
# Overcoming immune checkpoint blockade resistance in solid tumors with intermittent ITK inhibition
 - dampening TCR signaling with ITK inhibitor can confer ICB sensitivity to ICB resistant solid tumors
# Pan-cancer analysis reveals alternative splicing characteristics associated with immune-related adverse events elicited by checkpoint immunotherapy
 - expression levels of some splicing factors correlates ok with irAE risk
 - **doesn't seem to be the case here that alternative splicing (as a source of neoantigens) is increased in irAE patients and irAEs were caused by increased neoantigen load, so their model instead is that splicing's effects on irAE risk instead perhaps due to altered protein function i.e. alternative splice variant has different function that leads to irAEs**
# Pan-MHC and cross-species prediction of T cell receptor-antigen binding
 - new AI assisted method
# Patient HLA class I genotype influences cancer response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy
## Abstract
 - HLA-I loci heterozygosity associated with better survival (3 major HLA-I genes: A-C)
 - HLA-B44 supertype also associated with better survival, HLA-B62 supertype associated with worse survival
## Main
 - **each HLA-I variant binds a select repertoire of peptide ligands, so HLA-I heterozygosity may increase diversity of peptides presented to T cells**
# Patterns of neurological adverse events among a retrospective cohort of patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - 1.72% incidence of neurological irAEs, mostly peripheral (vs. central)
 - melanoma and renal cell carcinoma associated with neurological irAEs, perhaps related to frequency of brain metastases in these tumor types
# PD-1 and ICOS coexpression identifies tumor-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in human solid tumors
 - identify subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells distinct from FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs that coexpress PD-1 and ICOS, Trm phenotype, expansion in tumor but rare in periphery, recognize both neoantigens and tumor-associated antigens
# PD-1 blockade augments Th1 and Th17 and suppresses Th2 responses in peripheral blood from patients with prostate and advanced melanoma cancer
 - PD-(L)1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in cancer
 - PD-1 blockade shifts towards proinflammatory Th1/17 response (enhanced IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, reduced Th2 cytokines IL-5/13)
# PD-1 blockade induces responses by inhibiting adaptive immune resistance
 - adaptive immune resistance: upregulation of PD-L1 on cancer tissues, interaction with PD-1 on antigen-specific CD8 T cells
 - here, show that pre-existing CD8 T cells on tumor margin associated with expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and may predict response to therapy
 - responding patients showed proliferation of intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - pre-treatment samples from responders show higher numbers of CD8, PD-1, PD-L1 expressing cells at invasive tumor margin and inside tumors, more **clonal TCR repertoire**
# PD-1 blockade in tumors with mismatch-repair deficiency
 - mismatch repair deficiency status predicts clinical benefit of ICI (ICI works better with tumors with mismatch repair deficiency)
 - **immune infiltrate associated with mismatch repair-deficient carcinomas directed at neoantigens**
# PD-1 limits IL-2 production and thymic regulatory T cell development
 - previously unknown how PD-1 limits Treg development
 - mice
 - PD-1 deficient Tregs have reduced TCR signaling
 - PD-1 deficient T cells produce more IL-2 (Treg limiting cytokine)
# PD-1 maintains CD8 T cell tolerance towards cutaneous neoantigens
 - mouse model, skin-specific expression of T cell antigens in epidermis
 - PD-1 maintains skin tolerance by preventing tissue-infiltrating antigen-specific CD8 T cells from becoming fully functional and gaining acess to epidermal APCs
# PD-L1 expression affects neoantigen presentation
 - PD-L1 expression on tumor related to ICB prognosis, but can get clinical benefit even without tumor PD-L1 expression and PD-L1 expression on tumor doesn't guarentee response
 - mice
 - responsiveness of T cells to neoantigens is key
 - T cells in PD-L1 expressing tumors are weak (exhausted?), PD-L1 deficient tumor T cells can have stronger antitumor response via ICB
# PD-L1 inhibitor-induced thyroiditis is associated with better overall survival in cancer patients
 - 21% of 91 patients with PD-1 blockade developed thyroid irAE
 - irAE associated with anti tumor response
# Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets predict the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer
 - high CD4<sup>+<sup>CD45RA<sup>-</sup> T cell and low CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte associated with better ICI prognosis
 - CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells higher in patients with irAEs
 - CD8<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup>T cell associated with irAEs
# Peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes predict the efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in cancer patients
 - CD8<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> T cell level associated with ICI efficacy but also irAE development
# Peripheral immune mapping and multi-omics analysis in PD-1 inhibitor-induced myocarditis
 - scRNAseq on CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells from 46 cancer patients, 16 with ICI-induced myocarditis
 - effector T cells in periphery increased in irAE patients, naive T cells, γδ T cells, and MAITs decreased in irAE patients
# Peripheral T cell expansion predicts tumor infiltration and clinical response
## Abstract
 - clonotypic expansion of effector-like T cells within tumor and in normal adjacent tissue, associated with ICB response
 - expanded clonotypes in tumor and normal adjacent tissue can be detected in peripheral blood
 - intratumoral T cells are replaced with fresh, non-exhausted cells from outside the tumor, especially in responsive patients
 - **non-exhausted T cells from periphery may be key in explaining ICB response**
## Main
 - parallel expansion in tumor and normal adjacent tissue may be from infiltration of T cells from periphery (extravasating into both tumor and normal adjacent tissue from blood)
# Phenotypic signatures of circulating neoantigen-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in patients with metastatic cancers
## Abstract
 - circulating antitumor T cells are rarer and less dysfunctional than neoantigen TILs but target same neoantigens, only partially share TCR repertoire with TILs
## Introduction
 - **apparently possible to identify antitumor TCRs from TIL transcriptomic state, and here they extend that to PBMCs?**
## Results
 - circulating tumor reactive T cells: lower expression of cytotoxic molecules, higher expression of T cell activation genes, memory quiescence, tissue residency, inhibitory markers
# Polyamine metabolism is a central determinant of helper T cell lineage fidelity
 - polyamine synthesis undergoes profound changes during T cell activation, along with other metabolic changes
 - polyamine metabolism governs CD4 lineage commitment
# Polygenic risk score for ulcerative colitis predicts immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated colitis
 - genetic susceptibility to UC (not Crohn's) seems to predispose to irAE-colitis
# Positive correlation of peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes with immune-related adverse events and combinatorial prognostic value in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - baseline level of peripheral CD8 Ts risk factor for irAE onset, also associated with longer survival
# Potentiating local and abscopal antitumor efficacy through radiation with FAP-CD40 DARPin and anti-PD1 therapy
 - ~70% of patients develop resistance to ICI
 - CD40: costimulatory molecule that drives DCs and TAMs (tumor associated macrophages) to prime T cells
 - FAP: fibroblast activation protein, upregulated in tumor in response to radiation (which can be taken advantage of for drug delivery to TME via FAP-CD40 DARPin)
 - FAP-CD40 DARPin: uses FAP and CD40 binding domains to cross-link and activate CD40 specifically in tumor
# Predicting crossreactivity and antigen specificity of T cell receptors
 - TCRs can also recognize non-peptide antigens
 - a single TCR can recognize 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> epitopes but once it reacts with one the probability of it reacting with another reduces to ~10<sup>-4</sup>, **not sure why that is**
 - **as memory T cells are more sensitive han naive T cells (can be stimulated at ~50x lower [peptide]), tolerance can breakdown if naive self-reactive T cells are stimulated in crossreactive manner to foreign peptide**
# Predicting response and toxicity to PD-1 inhibition using serum autoantibodies identified from immuno-mass spectrometry
 - Thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) candidate autoantibody targets, higher levels of autoantibodies targeting these proteins associated with irAEs
# Prediction of tumor-reactive T cell receptors from scRNA-seq data for personalized T cell therapy
 - previous approaches to get tumor-reactive TCRs: analyze tumor mutations, predict T cell activating neoantigens, enrich TIL cultures for tumor-reactive T cells
 - here, they instead combine high-throughput TCR cloning and reactivity validation to train a machine learning model that identifies tumor-reactive TILs in antigen-agnostic manner based on single-TIL RNAseq
# Predictive and sensitive biomarkers for thyroid dysfunctions during treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors
 - early increase in serum thyroglobulin levels and thyroid autoantibodies associated with thyroid irAE
# Predictive biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor immune-related adverse events
 - irAEs in ~40% of patients
 - no biomarkers have been validated in prospective studies
 - irAE thyroiditis more likely in patients with anti-thyroid antibodies pre-treatment
 - **CD8 T expansion/diversification with ICI associated with irAE, diversification within first 2 weeks of ICI**
 - **irAE colitis associated with higher counts of CD4 T cells, fewer Tregs at baseline**
# Predictive biomarkers of immune checkpoint inhibitor-based mono- and combination therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma
 - pre-treatment tumoral PD-L1 expression level (higher associated with longer survival)
 - pre-treatment intratumoral CD38<sup>+</sup> proportion (higher associated with longer survival)
# Preexisting autoantibodies as predictor of immune related adverse events (irAEs) for advanced solid tumors treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)
 - autoantibody panel: anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic, anti-nuclear, rheumatoid factor, anti-thyroid peroxidase, and anti-thyroglobulin
 - more frequent severe irAEs in patients with preexisting autoantibodies, irAEs occur earlier in those with preexisting autoantibodies
# Preserving the CTLA-4 checkpoint for safer and more effective cancer immunotherapy
 - previous literature: irAEs and cancer immunotherapeutic effects (CITE) are distinct and therapeutically separatable, former attributable to CTLA-4 blockade and latter to selective depletion of Tregs in TME, **not sure of evidence for this**
 - here, they argue for safer and more effective CTLA-4-targeting immune therapy via preservation (not inhibition) of CTLA-4 checkpoint while still depleting Tregs in TME
# Prevalence of immune-related adverse events and anti-tumor efficacy following immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in Japanese patients with various solid tumors
 - combination ICB increases irAE risk
 - baseline eosinophil count predicts liver-irAE
# Prior antibiotic administration disrupts anti-PD-1 responses in advanced gastric cancer by altering the gut microbiome and systemic immune response
 - perhaps mechanism here is via changes to gut microbiome
# Prior imune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is associated with decreased COVID-19-related hospitalizations and complications in patients with cancer: results of a propensity-matched analysis of the OnCovid registry
 - COVID-19 pathology/mortality related to overactive immune response, so perhaps surprising for ICI (augmenting immune response) to help with COVID-19
# Prior viral infection primes cross-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that respond to mouse heart allografts
 - rejection after transplant due to viral-specific T cells that crossreact to alloantigen
# Protective effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related myocarditis via fune-tuning of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation
 - 
# Quantifiable predictive features define epitope-specific T cell receptor repertoires
## Abstract
 - TCR is heterodimer, mediates pathogen-associated epitope recognition through interactions between peptide and MHC, generated by genomic rearrangement of germline TCR locus (VDJ recombination) to allow potentially 10^15 to 10^61 unique receptors
 - TCRs from T cells that recognize the same pMHC epitope often share conserved sequence features, perhaps able to predict model epitope specificity
 - here, they study CD8<sup>+</sup> TCRs in mice and humans to study these conserved features as well as features differentiating them
 - **takehome: each epitope-specific repertoire studied had a clustered group of receptors with core sequence similarities plus a dispersed set of diverse "outlier" sequences, so some similar but some different sort of unhelpful**
# Rechallenge of immune checkpoint inhibitors in a case with adverse events inducing myasthenia gravis
 - ICI-induced myasthenia gravis (MG) irAE associated with germline variant in *SLC22A5* in thymoma case
# Regulatory  T cell-specific epigenomic region variants are a key determinant of susceptibility to common autoimmune diseases
 - SNPs associated with autoimmunity enriched in CpG demethylated regions in naive Tregs, less enriched in activation-induced demethylated regions in Tconv/Tregs
# Regulatory T cells suppress CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cell activation by controlling protein synthesis
## Abstract
 - Tregs suppress CD4 effector T cells
 - Tregs suppress activation-induced global protein synthesis in CD4 effector T cells before cell division
 - mRNAs encoding for protein synthesis machinery regulated at translational level in activated CD4 effector T cells by Tregs
 - Tregs suppress global protein synthesis of CD4 effector T cells by inhibiting mRNAs of translation machinery at level of mTORC1-mediated translational control via immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGFβ
 - RNA helicase eIF4A inhibitor rocaglamide A can alleviate inflammatory CD4 effector T cell activation by Treg depletion *in vivo*
## Introduction
 - FOXP3 mutations can drive autoimmunity, linked to loss of functional Tregs
 - Tregs can suppress CD4 effector T cells directly or through modulation of APCs (mostly DCs)
 - proposed suppression mechanisms: suppressive cytokine release (TGFβ, IL-10, IL-35), inhibitory receptor expression (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT)
 - upon activation, resting T cells undergo rapid reprogramming in preparation of cell division, includes increased translation
# Regulatory T cell transcriptomic reprogramming characterizes adverse events by checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors
## Abstract
 - focus on Tregs as they help maintain peripheral tolerance, appear expanded in peripheral blood of cancer patients, and abundantly express checkpoint molecules
 - results: transcriptomic reprogramming of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> CD127<sup>-</sup> Tregs in the blood of individuals with advanced metastatic melanoma who develop irAEs following ICI immunotherapy, with a characteristic inflammatory, apoptotic and metabolic signature
 - inflammatory signature shared by Tregs from individuals with different types of cancer developing irAEs and individuals with autoimmune diseases
## Discussion
 - inflammatory transcriptional reprogramming of Tregs, enrichment of transcripts like *IFNG*, *STAT1*, *RORC* and *STAT3*
 - previous literature: irAEs are similar to autoimmune conditions since TNF blockade (autoimmune therapy) helps with irAE symptoms in mice
# Repertoire analyses reveal T cell receptor sequence features that influence T cell fate
## Abstract
 - **TRB CDR3 hydrophobicity promotes reactivity to self-peptides**
## Introduction
 - TCR-pMHC signal strength drives fate decisions, i.e. too strong favors T<sub>reg</sub>, so TCR sequence features conceivably can influence fate decision
 - only analyze TRB CDR3s here
## Results
### T<sub>regs</sub> use specific amino acids in the CDR3β middle region
 - **middle region of T<sub>regs</sub> has more F, L, W, Y (hydrophobic residues) than effector T cells (which has more negatively charged residues than T<sub>regs</sub>)**
### CDR3β V and J regions explain variance in T cell state
 - previous literature: MHC genetic variation shapes frequency of *TR(A/B)V* gene usage in repertoire, ***TRAV* contacts MHC at more polymorphic sites, *TRBV* contacts MHC at more conserved sites**
 - *TRBV* gene usage explains significant amount of variance in T cell fate
### T<sub>regs</sub> are enriched for CDR1β charge and CDR3β hydrophobicity
 - specifically at positions p109/p110
### TiRP explains T<sub>reg</sub> plasticity in the tumor microenvironment
 - previous literature: naive T thymic emigrants can be peripherally induced to adopt regulatory phenotype, and T<sub>regs</sub> can lose *FOXP3* expression and adopt pro-inflammatory phenotype (exT<sub>regs</sub>), expanded clones observed as both T<sub>regs</sub> and conventional T cells may represent such lineages (mixed clones)
 - hypothesis: TCR features of these mixed clones may be intermediate, increasing conversion susceptibility
# Restriction of PD-1 function by *cis*-PD-L1/CD80 interactions is required for optimal T cell responses
 - CD80 binds PD-L1 in *cis* on primary activated DCs, interferes with PD-L1 accessing PD-1 on T cells (which would have otherwise inhibited T cell activation)
# Reversal of immune-checkpoint inhibitor fulminant myocarditis using personalized-dose-adjusted abatacept and ruxolitinib: proof of concept
 - Abatacept: CTLA-4 fusion protein targeting CD86 on APCs, leads to global T cell anergy
# Reversing T cell exhaustion in cancer: lessons learned from PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade
 - PD-1<sup>low</sup> T cells more responsive to PD-1 blockade than PD-1<sup>high</sup> T cells, consistent with Tpex more responsive than Tex
 - secondary lymphoid tissues (like LNs) are important for PD-1 blockade, **removing tumor-draining LN compromises efficacy of ICB**
# Rigorous benchmarking of T cell receptor repertoire profiling methods for cancer RNA sequencing
## Abstract
 - benchmarking ability of RNAseq methods (vs. gold standard of targeted TCRseq) to profile TCR repertoires, examine 19 bulk RNAseq samples across 4 cancer cohorts, T cell rich/poor tissue
 - RNAseq works ok in T cell rich tissue with low diversity repertoires, don't work as well in T cell poor tissues especially those with highly diverse repertoires
## Introduction
 - MiXCR (RNAseq method) has been shown to be able to detect TCR beta sequences with relative frequencies > 0.15% in T cell rich tissue
## Results
 - multi-cohort dataset
### RNA-seq based TCR profiling methods were able to successfully capture TCR beta low SDI repertoires across various T cell rich tissues
 - capturing ability based on sum of TCRseq confirmed TCR beta clonotypes captured in RNAseq methods
 - RNAseq methods capture ~93% of clonotypes in T cell rich low SDI samples, ~76% in T cell poor low SDI samples (averages)
 - capture fewer clonotypes in high SDI samples
 - CATT and TRUST4 did better than MiXCR in T cell poor high SDI samples
 - figure 1. A-D: RNAseq methods do well in T cell rich low SDI samples (capture all clonotypes with frequencies > ~0.04% in T cell rich low SDI samples, > ~2.7% in T cell poor low SDI samples), E-F: RNAseq methods capture clonotypes with frequencies > ~1.5% in T cell rich high SDI samples, E-H: threshold for T cell poor high SDI samples varies ~10-40%
 - supplementary tables/figures: fewer RNAseq TCR reads in T cell poor tissue vs. T cell rich tissue (4.1 vs. 655.3 TCR reads/million RNAseq reads)
 - RNAseq methods can capture most of top clonotypes
### RNA-seq-based TCR profiling methods were able to effectively estimate clonality in T cell rich tissues
 - lower error between RNAseq and TCRseq based diversity estimates in SDI low tissue
 - figure 2
 - also looked at clonality to account for number of clonotypes (SDI doesn't take into account)
## Discussion
 - TCRseq costs more than RNAseq?
# Risk factors and biomarkers for immune-related adverse events: a practical guide to identifying high-risk patients and re-challenging immune checkpoint inhibitors
 - higher risk of irAE associated with age < 60 years, high BMI, women on CTLA-4, men on PD-1 blockade, chronic smoking, pre-existing autoimmune disease, anti-inflammatory drug use, 
 - organ-specific irAEs associated with pre-existing organ dysfunction
 - high pre-treatment soluble CTLA4 associated with irAEs
# Risk of colitis in immune checkpoint inhibitors and in chemotherapy/placebo for solid tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis
 - CTLA-4 blockade more likely to induce colitis than PD-1 blockade
 - NSCLC patients with ICB less likely to develop colitis than melanoma patients
# Role of B cells as antigen presenting cells
 - B2s: conventional B cells
 - Bregs: suppress inflammation, < 1% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
 - activation of B cells as APCs occurs via BCR (T-cell dependent) or via germline encoded PAMP receptors (T cell independent)
# Role of CD38 in anti-tumor immunity of small cell lung cancer
 - ICB (+/- chemotherapy) has modest benefits in patients with SCLC (high TMB, low PD-L1 expression, aren't biomarkers of ICB response)
 - CD38 levels correlate with levels of immunosuppressive markers *FOXP3*, *PD-1*, and *CTLA-4*
 - CD38 levels increase after chemotherapy and ICB
# Role of recombination activating genes in the generation of antigen receptor diversity and beyond
## Abstract
 - V(D)J recombination: antigen receptor gene segments cleaved, rejoined by NHEJ
 - RAG1/2 (recombination activating genes) drive cleavage, sequence specific nucleases
## The discovery of *RAG* genes
 - RAG1/2 unique to vertebrates
## Antigen receptors of lymphoid system
 - antibodies/immunoglobulins are glycoproteins composed of 4 polypeptides (2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light chains held together by disulfide bonds)
 - N-terminal sequences of antibodies (variable region, 110-130 residues) vary greatly and gives antigen specificity, C-terminal seqences more constant (constant region)
 - exon encoding variable region (N-terminus of antibodies) assembled from 2 or 3 gene segments: V (variable), D (diversity, only for immunoglobulin heavy chains, TCR-β, and TCR-δ), J (joining)
 - recombination between D and J occurs to yield DJ segment, and recombination between V and DJ occurs to yield VDJ segment
 - TCR structure similar to antigen-binding fragment (F(ab)) of antibody, also has 2 glycoprotein subunits each encoded by rearranged gene, also has interchain disulfide bonds
 - TCRs are αβ or γδ pairs
 - heavy chain recombination occurs before light chain recombination (strict order, same as D-J before V-DJ and TCR-β before TCR-α), cell cycle restricted expression of enzymes helps enforce order
 - rearrangements restricted to early developmental stage
 - allelic exclusion: process by which specificity is acquired for mature lymphocytes to only express a single species of antibody/BCR/TCR in spite of having multiple allelic loci for different options
## Antigen receptor loci
 - immunoglobulin heavy chain IgH and light chain kappa (IgK) and lambda (IgL)
## Mechanism of V(D)J recombination
### Recombination signal sequence and 12/23 rule
 - recombination signal sequence (RSS): fairly conserved, adjacent to each subexon, heptamer and nonamer sequence separated by spacer of 12 or 23 bp (12RSS, 23RSS)
 - generally, 12RSS recombines only with 23RSS (and vice versa), '12/23' rule (prevents non-productive rearrangements)
### The perfect cleavage
 - RAG1/2 initiate recombination by introducing ssDNA nick at border of RSS and coding segment
### The imperfect joining
 - blund-ended signal ends can be ligated diereclty, coding ends undergo further processing (NHEJ)
## Diversity at the junction
 - when V, D, and J subexons join, several modifications like insertions and deletions can occur at junctions
## Other modes of generation of the diversity
### Class switch recombination (CSR)
 - rearrangements of constant regions upon encountering an antigen, switching of immunoglobulin isotype from IgM to IgG/E/A without changing antigen specificity
### Somatic hypermutation (SHM)
 - random genetic mutations in B cells (not T cells) at certain hotspots in antigen-binding regions following antigen encounter, increases affinity of antibodies for antigen (cells secreting antibodies that increase affinity expand)
 - within V region of heavy and light chains
# Role of the multiple T cell receptor (TCR)-ζ chain signaling motifs in selection of the T cell repertoire
 - TCR is composed of four distinct signal transducing subunits (CD3-γ, -δ, -ε, and ζ) that contain either one (CD3-γ, -δ, -ε) or three (-ζ) signaling motifs (ITAMs) within their intracytoplasmic domains
# Safety, outcomes and T cell characteristics in patients with relapsed or refractory MDS or CMML treated with atezolizumab in combination with guadecitabine
 - hypothesis: resistance to hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) overcome by combining PD-L1 blockade with HMA
# scRNAseq defines dynamic T cell subsets in longitudinal colon and peripheral blood samples in immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis
 - n = 1 but has PBMC and colon scRNA/TCR data...
 - colon Trm, also circulating T cells, driving inflammation in colon
# Serum cytokines predict efficacy and toxicity, but are not useful for disease monitoring in lung cancer treated with PD-(L)1 inhibitors
 - baseline levels of IL-1β and angiogenin associated with irAEs
# Serum immune modulators associated with immune-related toxicities and efficacy of atezolizumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
 - high baseline levels of B cell-activating factor (BAFF) associated with irAE development
 - increased ICOS levels during first therapeutic cycle associated with survival
# Sharing of T cell receptors in antigen-specific responses is driven by convergent recombination
 - convergent recombination, rather than recombination bias or selection, drives publicity
 - potential causes of publicity: self tolerance restricts capacity of TCRs to recognize some epitopes, different conformations of peptides in MHC groove (flat or prominent), degenerate binders
# Significance of the autoantibody assay in predicting the development of immune-related adverse events in patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma
 - irAE patients more likely to have autoantibody and to have complete ICB-response
# Simultaneous epitope and transcriptome measurement in single cells
 - cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies are used to integrate cellular protein and transcriptome measurements into a single cell readout
 - DNA oligonucleotide conjugated to antibody can be measured by sequencing as digital readout of protein abundance
 - conjugate antibodies to oligonucleotides designed to be captured by oligo dT-based RNAseq library preparation, contain barcode sequence to identify the antibody, and allow PCR amplification
 - adopt streptavidin-biotin interaction to link 5' of oligos to antibodies, include disulfide link to allow oligo to be released from antibody in reducing conditions
 - incubate antibody-oligo complexes with single cell suspensions, then wash cells to remove unbound antibodies and perform scRNA-seq (of both cellular mRNAs and antibody-derived oligos that both anneal to polyT-containing microparticles via 3' polyA tails)
 - unique barcode sequence on oligos attached to microparticles indexes cDNA of mRNAs and antibody-oligos of each cell in RT reaction
 - amplified antibody-derived tags and cDNA molecules separated by size
# Single cell analyses identify circulating anti-tumor CD8 T cells and markers for their enrichment
## Abstract
 - shared CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones between blood and tumor in melanoma patients, blood clones less dysfunctional than matched T cells in tumor and more activated than non-matching T cells in blood
 - PD-1 poor sensitivity for identifying matched tumor cells in blood, perhaps because PD-1 also an activation marker and activated T cells in blood may not be tumor-specific
## Results
### Activated TM CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can be detected in the blood of melanoma patients
 - 4 patients, no ICB
### TM CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can be tracked longitudinally in patient blood and show a temporal increase in exhaustion despite anti-PD-1 treatment
 - 2 followup samples
 - higher exhaustion signature than initial sample, but still lower exhaustion than tumor
## Discussion
 - majority of tumor matched cells in blood in melanoma patients show effector or effector memory-like phenotype, contrary to exhausted-like profile prediction
# Single cell analyses inform mechanisms of myeloid-targeted therapies in colon cancer
 - macrophage and convential DC subsets as key mediators of cross-talk in TME
# Single cell analyses reveal key immune cell subsets associated with response to PD-L1 blockade in triple-negative breast cancer
 - high baseline levels of CXCL13<sup>+</sup> T cells linked to proinflammatory features of macrophages, can predict response

# Single cell ATAC-seq maps the comprehensive and dynamic chromatin accessibility landscape of CAR-T cell dysfunction
 - CAR-T cells get exhausted, epigenetic state change via BATF/IRF4
# Single cell dynamics of tumor specificity vs bystander activity in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells define the diverse immune landscapes in colorectal cancer
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation via ICB successful in microsatellite instable (MSI, high TMB, more TILs) colorectal cancer, limited success against microsatellite stable (MSS, lower TMB, fewer TILs) colorectal cancer
 - MSI CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show tumor-specific activation, MSS CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show tumor unspecific or bystander features
 - **prior literature: T cells that crossreact have higher *EOMES* and *KLRG1* expression**
# Single cell RNA-seq reveals expanded clones of islet antigen-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood of subjects with type 1 diabetes
 - unclear significance of islet antigen reactive T cells in peripheral blood of T1D patients (similar cells in healthy control subjects)
 - hypothesis: key disease associated cells show evidence of prior antigen exposure, inferred from expanded TCR clonotypes and essential phenotypic properties in their transcriptomes
 - testing hypothesis: scRNAseq to identify TCR clonotypes and transcript phenotypes, apply analysis to islet antigen reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells from T1D and healthy control subjects following activation with pooled islet peptides
 - TCR results: extensive TCR clonotype sharing in antigen activated cells especially from T1D subjects, consistent with *in vivo* T cell expansion during disease progression, stable clonotypes (detect at repeat visits), see no clonotype sharing between subjects ("private" TCR specificities), IGRP seems to be a trigger for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion (recognized by expanded clones from two T1D subjects)
 - transcript results: overall transcript profiles from healthy controls and T1D subjects similar, most expanded clone profiles distinctive though
# Single cell RNA sequencing reveals distinct T cell populations in immune-related adverse events of checkpoint inhibitors
## Abstract
 - different subsets of T cells are associated with irAEs, can use these cells before ICI treatment as biomarkers to predict irAEs
 - for example, patients with immune-related arthritis have lower levels of CD8 T<sub>CM</sub> (central memory) cells at baseline, patients with immune-related pneumonitis have more CD4 T<sub>H2</sub> (subset of T helper cells that mediate activation/maintenance of antibody-mediated immune response against parasites, bacteria, allergens, toxins) cells at baseline, and patients with immune-related thyroiditis have more  CD4 T<sub>H17</sub> (secrete IL-17A cytokine, involved in defense at mucosal/epithelial barriers) cells at baseline
 - about half of patients develop irAEs from PD-1 blockade
 - methods: they use the K-nearest neighbor-based network graph-drawing layout to investigate subpopulations of T cells
## Introduction
 - prior history of autoimmune disease is one predictor of irAEs
 - perplexingly, irAEs are often organ specific (i.e. different patients have different affected organs)
 - methods: scRNAseq of peripheral blood T cells before/after ICI, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes sequencing (CITE-seq, simultaneously quantify cell surface protein and transcriptomic data within single cells using oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies) to stratify CD4 and CD8 T cells by naive and effector phenotypes, define molecular/cellular changes associated with T cell transition from self-tolerant to sensitized effector cells
## Results
### Dimensionality reduction approach to visualize scRNAseq data of patients with irAEs
 - able to see some dominant clusters among patients developing irAEs
 - some clusters show changes in relative percentages of cell populations before/after ICI
### Gene marker based cluster annotation identifies effector, regulatory, and memory subsets of peripheral T cells
 - 14/25 clusters express CD3E, 6 of which were dominated by CD8A and 8 by CD4
 - naive (i.e. Th0) CD8 T cells characterized by CD45RA, CCR7, SELL (CD62L0, LEF1)
 - central memory CD8 T cells contain CCR7, SELL, CD27 as well as CD44, CXCR3, FAS, CD28
 - subset of effector CD8 T cells express TBX21, cytotoxic markers like GZMB, KLRD1, PRF1, CD3E
 - effector memory CD8 T cells display EMOS, GZMK, IFNG
 - mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in all patients, **see higher expression of activation genes in patients with no irAEs vs. yes irAEs**
 - CD8 T helper cells express GATA3
 - wanted to investigate variability in T cells between patients with and without irAEs, perform gene set signature analysis: association of irAE T cells with T cell activation and cytokine secretion genes, so irAE T cells seem to be more associated with effector functions vs. regulatory functions
### Patients with immune-related arthritis have higher percentages of CD4 TH cells at baseline
 - enhanced T cell subset transition from naive (Th0) to effector in patients who develop arthritis serves as evidence of pervasive immune responsiveness
### Selected subsets of CD4 TH cells are associated with organ-specific irAEs
 - thyroiditis patients have more CD4 TH cells expressing RORC, IL-21
### Patients with inflammatory arthritis have lower levels of CD8 T<sub>CM</sub> cells at baseline
### Patients with immune-related pneumonitis have distinctive distributions of T cell populations
## Discussion
 - PD-1 PD-L1 interaction promotes TE cell exhaustion, supports conversion of TE cells into suppressive T<sub>reg</sub> cells
 - irAEs are frequent in patients treated with ICIs (~90% of patients treated with PD-1 blockade and/or CTLA-4 blockade), severe/life threatening (grades 3/4, respectively) irAEs in fewer but still many patients
 - at baseline, patients with arthritis had less cells with features of CD8 T<sub>CM</sub> cells, patients with pneumonitis had more CD4 T<sub>H2</sub> cells, patients with thyroiditis had more CD4 T<sub>H17</sub> cells, so **different populations of T cells are associated with different irAEs, and quantification/characterization of T cell populations before ICI treatment can serve as predictive biomarkers**
# Single cell sequencing links multiregional immune landscapes and tissue-resident T cells in ccRCC to tumor topology and therapy efficacy
 - clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) highly immune infiltrated
 - only n = 2 per group (untreat, resistant, responsive)
 - enriched CD8A<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident T cells in patient responder to ICB, tumor-associated macrophages in resistant patient
# Single cell T cell landscape and T cell receptor repertoire profiling of AML in context of PD-1 blockade therapy
 - TCR repertoires expand in responders, contract in therapy resistant patients
# Single cell T cell receptor sequencing: techniques and future challenges
 - αβ T cells are > 90% of T cell population; γδ T cells are less diverse and aren't MHC-restricted and are involved in innate-like responses instead
 - D-J joining happens first, then V-D-J joining for TCR β
 - CDR1-2 in V gene, CDR3 at junction of V, (D), and J
 - first sequencing-based techniques to look at CDR3 looked at CDR3 length distributions (electrophoresis of PCR fragments from amplifying across CDR3), Gaussian (normal) distribution with polyclonal TCRs and skewed with clonal enrichment
# Single cell transcriptomics identifies pathogenic T-helper 17.1 cells and pro-inflammatory monocytes in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis
 - enrichment of CD4s and CD8s in ICI-pneumonitis bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, also DCs enriched
 - enriched CD4s showed increased pathogenic Th 17.1, type 1 Tregs, naive-like cells, high expression of *TBX21* (T-bet), RORC, IFN-γ, *IL-17A*, *CSF2*, cytotoxicity genes
 - enriched CD8s: TEMs
 - myeloid cells in ICI-pneumonitis samples: depleted of anti-inflammatory resident alveolar macrophages, enriched for pro-inflammatory monocytes (M1-like)
 - feedforward loop between Th17.1 cells (produce GM-CSF) and pro-inflammatory monocytes (respond to GM-CSF, produce IL-23 that Th17.1 respond to) seen here, also characterized in different autoimmune diseases
 - **they don't specifically have proliferating T clusters (although they do see higher activation which may be functionally redundant), so I can see if proliferating (CD4) T cells are up in pneumonitis**
# SLC7A7 is a prognostic biomarker correlated with immune infiltrates in non-small cell lung cancer
 - SLC7A7 expression associated with poor overall survival in lung cancer patients, positively correlated with immune cell infiltration
# Society for immunotherapy of cancer (SITC) consensus definitions for immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated immune-related adverse events (irAEs) terminology
 - recurrent irAEs: in same organ at least twice after ICI discontinuation
 - delayed/late onset irAEs: > 3 months after ICI discontinuation
 - chronic irAEs: persist > 3 months after ICI discontinuation (active if requiring immunosuppression due to ongoing inflammation, inactive if not)
 - multisystem irAEs: irAEs in different organ systems (or different tissues within same system if in 1 system)
 - steroid-resistant irAEs: some benefit but dont resolve with steroids (vs. steroid unresponsive or dependent)
# Soluble and cell-based markers of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated nephritis
 - sIL-2R (circulating form of IL-2Rα i.e. CD25) higher in blood of nephritis patients
 - lower CD8 T, CD45RA CD8 T, memory CD27 B features of nephritis patients as well, also plasmablast expansion
# Specificity of T cell alloreactivity
 - many alloreactive T cells are much more peptide specific than previously thought, few if any recognize only the MHC molecule
 - alloreactive T cells are polyspecific, able to recognize multiple distinct peptide-MHC complexes (perhaps why there's a high frequency of allorecognition)
# Specificity, privacy, and degeneracy in the CD4 T cell receptor repertoire following immunization
 - math to back up hundreds to thousands of TCRs for any given antigen in a repertoire
 - mice
# Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 alterations and myocarditis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors: a case report
 - case report of patient with metastatic HER2 NSCLC with high PD-L1 level
 - started on pembrolizumab
 - ICI-induced myocarditis before third ICI cycle
# Statistical analysis of CDR3 length distributions for the assessment of T and B cell repertoire biases
 - Gaussian-like distribution in length pattern, given large number of small effects (random mechanism of junction diversity) acting additively and independently on CDR3 length
# Stitchr: stitching coding TCR nucleotide sequences from V/J/CDR3 information
 - leader sequence/signal peptide just refers to signal for TCR to be trafficked to cell membrane
# Strategies to reinvigorate exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumor microenvironment
 - strategies to reinvigorate Tex: expand Tpex and Tex (i.e. via ICB), promote Tpex differentiation into Tex that are less exhausted (superior effector function), promote self-renewal of Tex (i.e. IL-10), promote Tpex differentiation into other subsets
 - **Tpex likely main target of PD-(L)1 blockade, increased expansion and differentiation into less exhausted Tex**
# Structural basis for self-discrimination by neoantigen-specific TCRs
 - mouse study
 - **high functional avidity/structural affinity is a feature of neoantigen-reactive TCRs, perhaps necessary to recognize tumor cells that are selected to have low density of antigens on their cell surface (to try and evade immune system) and/or perhaps related to differentiation between neoantigen peptide on tumor cells and WT peptide on healthy cells**
 - **unknown questions: how do some neoantigen-reactive TCRs selectively recognize mutated peptides and not crossreact with WT peptides while others crossreact a lot? why are non-synonymous mutations rarely recognized by TCRs?**
 - **crossreactivity may be determined by MHC discrimination i.e. it's MHC presenting peptide that actually matters for TCR discerning self vs. tumor vs. the peptide mutation mattering**
# Structural basis for T cell recognition of cancer neoantigens and implications for predicting neoepitope immunogenicity
 - oncogenic mutations can improve antigen presentation by strengthening pMHC binding, mutation can also be detected by direct interactions with TCR
# Structure-based, rational design of T cell receptors
 - TCRs have constant domains (anchor to cell membrane) and variable domains (interact with pMHC)
 - CDRs come from hypervariable regions of V domains
 - CDR1/2 interact mostly with MHC
# Successful treatment of arthritis induced by checkpoint inhibitors with tocilizumab: a case series
 - irAEs are inflammatory side effects from ICIs
 - ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis has been reported
 - corticosteroids can treat mild irAEs, TNFα inhibitors reserved for severe cases (prolonged TNFα inhibitor use can negatively impact antitumor effect of ICI)
 - here, they try instead to use the anti IL6 receptor antibody (FDA approved to treat RA) for ICI-induced arthritis
# Systematically administered low-affinity HER2 CAR T cells mediate antitumor efficacy without toxicity
 - disadvantage of high-affinity CARs for targets like HER2 expressed on normal tissues, low-affinity HER2 CARs can safely regress tumors
# Targeted reconstruction of T cell receptor sequence from single cell RNA-seq links CDR3 length to T cell differentiation status
## Abstract
 - TRAPeS tool to extract TCRseq from short read scRNAseq libraries (previous methods needed long sequencing reads)
 - **'naive-like' memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have longer and less germline-like CDR3s than effector-memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells**
## Introduction
 - some antigen-experienced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have naive-like phenotype (can respond to antigen but show transcriptome/surface markers like antigen-naive T cell)
 - several dozen V and J loci for selection pool for V(D)J recombination
 - **public CDR3s often shorter, perhaps more efficient recombination**
## Methods
 - TRAPeS: identify putative pairs of V and J segments, collect putative CDR3-originating reads, reconstruct CDR3, separate similar TCRs and determine chain productivity
## Results
### Combined TCR-transcriptome analysis reveals longer CDR3 regions for naive-like YFV-specific cells
 - **they calculate germline score as ratio between number of nucleotides in CDR3 that originate from germline V(D)J segments to total number of nucleotides in CDR3, need stitching and IMGT/HighV-QUEST for this**
 - **naive-like cells have longer CDR3s and lower germline scores for both α and β chains than effector memory-like cells**
# Targeting of multiple tumor-associated antigens by individual T cell receptors during successful cancer immunotherapy
## Highlights
 - individual T cells can recognize multiple, different tumor-associated antigens
 - identification of new epitopes recognized by these "orphan" T cells
## Summary
 - in the context of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy
 - **shared x-x-x-A/G-I/L-G-I-x-x-x recognition motif was key for cross-reactive TCR**
## Introduction
 - "orphan" T cells refers to T cells with unknown specificities
 - example cross-reactive T cell here recognized 3 peptides: EAAGIGILTV from Melan A,  LLLGIGILVL from tetherin/CD317/BST2, and NLSALGIFST from IMP2
 - they use term "multipronged" whereas I've been reading/using cross-reactive, **these are different terms, multipronged for antigens on same cell and crossreactive for different antigens on different cells**
 - multipronged recognition resulted in superior recognition of cancer cells vs. recognition by single TAA
## Discussion
 - goal: what do cancer-specific T cells respond to following successful TIL therapy for stage IV melanoma
 - TIL infusion used to induce a complete response responded to a range of different cancer cell lines from different tissues, suggesting that the majority of the anticancer response in these TILs acted to target widely shared antigens rather than patient-specific, mutation-derived neoantigens
 - dominant T cell clonotype in Melan-A-reactive TIL persisted following remission, also responds to a wide range of cancer cell lines not expressing Melan A, suggesting response to widely expressed tumor associated antigens
# Targeting PI3Kα increases the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody in cervical cancer
 - *PIK3CA* mutation results in increase PD-L1 levels, repression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation in cervical cancer
# Targeting T regulatory (Treg) cells in immunotherapy-resistant cancers
 - high abundance of Tregs associated with resistance to ICB
# T cell characteristics associated with toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade in patients with melanoma
## Abstract
 - irAEs in 10-60% of patients with melanoma treated with ICI
 - **does a common baseline immunological state precede irAE?**
 - methods: mass cytometry, scRNAseq, single cell V(D)J sequencing, bulk RNAseq, bulk TCR sequencing to study peripheral blood from melanoma patients treated with PD-1 blockade (+/- CTLA-4 blockade)
 - **activated CD4 effector memory T abundance and TCR diversity associated with irAE**
## Introduction
 - SNP in microRNA-146a (regulates innate immunity, inflammation, antiviral pathway) linked with irAE
 - pre-existing autoantibodies, autoreactive tissue-resident T cells, and T cells with specificity for viral antigens (from chronic viral infections) also implicated in irAE
 - gut microbiome changes (leading to increased colonic IL-1ß) also linked with irAE
## Results
### Determinants of severe irAEs from pretreatment blood
 - CD4 effector memory T cells at higher levels in pretreatment blood associated with severe irAE
 - single cell TCR clonotype diversity of activated CD4 T 5+3 (**two clusters I think**) cells elevated in patients with severe irAEs, so TCR richness eclipses loss of diversity resulting from clonal expansion, also see a trend between bulk (not just activated CD4) TCR diversity in pretreatment samples and irAE development although the association is primarily attributable to CD4 T cells with effector memory profile (BCR diversity not associated with irAE as much)
### Extended analysis of T cell features associated with irAEs
 - verify scRNAseq findings with bulk RNAseq of additional patient blood samples (again see association between CD4 TEM cell levels and severe irAE development as well as higher TCR clonotype diversity predicting severe irAE development)
 - a composite model integrating activated CD4 TM cell abundance and bulk TCR diversity outperforms either feature alone in predicting severe irAE development regardless of ICI therapy type, ICI response status, age, sex, melanoma subtype, affected organ
 - model scores increase as a function of irAE severity, also predicts time to irAE development
### Peripheral TCR clonal expansion linked to severe irAEs
 - prior evidence of clonally expanded self/virus-reactive T cells in affected tissue linking self/pathogen-recognizing T cell clones to irAEs (**I wonder why viral antigen recognition would lead to irAEs, good for the viral-infected cells to be attacked, right? but perhaps its an inappropriately strong immune response**)
 - nonetheless, they hypothesize that pre-treatment TCR clonotypes in peripheral blood might show greater propensity to expand in patients destined to develop severe irAEs after ICI
 - observe increased TCR clonal expansion and persistence of baseline clones in patients developing severe irAEs (preferential expansion of activated CD4 TEM)
### Circulating leukocytes in autoimmune disease
 - does baseline peripheral blood profile of patients with severe irAEs resemble that of patients with autoimmune disease? compare to systemic lupus or IBD patients
 - circulating activated CD4 TM cells associated with autoimmune disorders
 - **severe irAEs may represent a subclinical or latent autoimmune state that is unmasked upon ICI treatment**, tracks with patients with autoimmune disease having flare ups after ICI treatment, **this may have implications for the investigation into the correlation between ICI clinical response and irAEs i.e. if you only observe irAEs in those predisposed to autoimmune conditions and if this doesn't relate to ICI clinical response then they won't always correlate**
## Discussion
 - identify two baseline features (activated CD4 TM cell abundance and more clonally diverse TCR repertoire in peripheral blood) as determinants of ICI-induced irAEs in melanoma patients
 - also find elevated activated CD4 TM cells in autoimmune disease patients, so perhaps a common immunological mechanism between irAEs and autoimmunity
 - previous studies had linked activated T cells and clonally expanded TCRs to severe irAEs but this study was uniquely looking at pre-treatment T cell characteristics
 - unanswered question: do circulating activated CD4 TM cells (their abundance here found to correlate with irAE development) exhibit a higher propensity to recognize self-antigens in patients at risk for severe ICI induced irAEs?
 - limitations: retrospective, different ICIs studied at same time here (each with different irAE risks), most irAEs occur within first 3 months but some can occur later (which would have been missed here, median time to severe irAE here was ~6 weeks with no irAEs after 3 months)
# T cell immune awakening in response to immunotherapy is age-dependent
 - patients > 70 have more clonal TCRs after ICB, younger show more diverse TCRs with ICB
# T cell invigoration to tumour burden ratio associated with anti-PD-1 response
## Abstract
### Background
 - monotherapies based on PD-1 (programmed cell death) blockade (i.e. to reinvigorate exhausted tumor-specific T cells) have been successful in durably treating some but not most melanoma patients
 - pre-existing T cell infiltration into tumor, presence of PD-L1 in tumors can be used as indicators of clinical responses (**guessing positive and negative prognosis respectively without PD-1 blockade treatment and both positive for PD-1 blockade**), although these indicators are not optimal, **need for better predictors of PD-1 blockade treatment effectiveness**
### Gap in field
 - immune blood profiling based understanding of PD-1 blockade mechanisms
### Methods
 - immune peripheral blood profiling of stage IV melanoma patients before/after PD-1 blockade (targeting antibody, pembrolizumab)
### Results
 - changes in circulating exhausted CD8 T cells
 - most patients show immune response to PD-1 blockade (pembrolizumab)
 - clinical failure mostly from imbalance between T cell reinvigoration and tumor burden
 - clinical response correlates with magnitude of T cell reinvigoration (relative to predrug burden)
 - **profile mechanistically relevant subpopulation of circulating T cells calibrated to predrug disease burden, able to identify clinically accessible predictor of PD-1 blockade treatment outcome**
 - **I'm curious how the calibration works above**
## Introduction
 - PD-L1 (ligand or PD-1 inhibitory receptor) expression in tumors suppress T cell response --> dysfunctional/exhausted T cells
 - exhausted T cells are less effective and exhibit distinct transcriptional profile compared to effector and memory CD8 T cells (**what I assume from it being said they have distinct differentiation patterns**)
 - **major challenge is knowing who will benefit from PD-1 blockade and who won't before giving the antibody treatment**
 - **goal: use peripheral blood profiling to detect responses to checkpoint (PD-1) blockade, identify relevant cell types... to better predict who will and who won't benefit from PD-1 blockade**
## Results
### Healthy donor vs. melanoma patients
 - all patients previously had anti-CTLA-4 therapy (a different checkpoint blockade treatment analogous to PD-1 blockade)
 - most patients didn't do well with PD-1 blockade (as measured by RECIST criteria guidelines)
 - comparative methods: flow cytometry (see frequencies of CD4, CD8 T cells, memory T cell subsets, co-expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors like PD-1, CTLA-4, 2B4, TIM-3 with CD4 or CD8), **perhaps high co-expression of PD-1 for example with CD4 and CD8 in T cells indicates likely exhaustion and therefore a good response to PD-1 blockade with reinvigoration of T cells, but later they see that anti PD-1 immune response isn't good predictor of clinical response**
 - evidence for prior immune response in melanoma patients (vs. healthy controls): higher CD4<sup>+</sup> FOXP3<sup>+</sup>  (**T<sub>reg</sub> marker**) T cell frequency, higher Ki67 expression by FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells, Ki67 higher in CD8 T cells in melanoma patients especially in PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cell subset, **higher proliferation (Ki67 is proliferation marker, also marks T cell reinvigoration, seems reasonable that exhausted T cells proliferate slower) and frequency of certain T cells (FOX3P is T<sub>reg</sub> marker, and T<sub>regs</sub> suppress immune responses**)
 - can also track proliferation with CFSE (fluorescence halves as cells divide, non-fluorescent until it enters cells and is hydrolyzed by enzymes and retained by cells)
### Pharmacodynamic immune response to anti PD-1
 - frequency of Ki67<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells goes up then down with PD-1 blockade treatment (figure 1B: count of cells with Ki67<sup>+</sup> over some threshold)
 - cytotoxic, proliferating Ki67<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cell population CD45RA<sup>low</sup> (**not sure of significance**), CD27<sup>high</sup> (**CD27<sup>low</sup> is effector T cell**), CTLA-4<sup>high</sup> and PD-1<sup>high</sup> (immune checkpoints), 2B4<sup>high</sup> (**not sure of significance**), Eomes<sup>high</sup> and T-bet<sup>low</sup> which **seems to** indicate a exhausted T cell phenotype
 - healthy patient Ki67<sup>+</sup> (proliferating) population largely Eomes<sup>high</sup> T-bet<sup>high</sup> (effector T cell phenotype), **so melanoma patients have more exhausted T cells than healthy patients, makes sense with consistent immune response to melanoma that expresses inhibitory receptors**
 - increased proliferation from treatment most evident in PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells (**evidence of immune response to PD-1 blockade**)
 - 74% of patients had PD-1 immune response, but only 38% had clinical response, **so anti PD-1 immune response is not a good predictor of clinical response**
### Reinvigorated T<sub>exhausted</sub> cells detected in peripheral blood
 - do CD8 PD-1<sup>+</sup> CTLA-4<sup>+</sup> T cells provide greater precision in tracking effects of PD-1 blockade? they seem to be mostly Eomes<sup>high</sup> T-bet<sup>low</sup> and CD45RAL<sup>low</sup> CD27<sup>high</sup>, **exhausted phenotype?**
 - also see increased Ki67 expression in these cells from treatment (50% Ki67<sup>+</sup> before treatment --> 75% Ki67<sup>+</sup> after treatment), much lower Ki67 expression in PD-1<sup>+</sup> CTLA-4<sup>-</sup> T cells (**so T cells expressing both inhibitory receptors are more reinvigorated from exhaustion?**)
 - **takeaway seems to be the more inhibitory receptors a T cell expresses, the more the cell responds to anti-PD-1 therapy, i.e. reinvigorate from exhausted state**
 - methods: mass cytometry (like flow cytometry but use heavy metal ion labeled antibodies instead of fluorochromes to get many more parameters and high dimensionally analyze single cells) and RNAseq
 - see PD-1 expressed by exhausted T cells, but also by memory (CCR7<sup>high</sup>) and effector (CD27<sup>low</sup>) T cells
 - see population of cells expressing exhaustion markers (Eomes, CD39) that increased in frequency and Ki67 expression after PD-1 blockade (reinvigoration), express granzymes (cytotoxic T cell method of killing target cells by inducing apoptosis)
### Responding T cell clones from blood found in tumor
 - the reinvigorated T<sub>ex</sub> cells in blood are also found in tumor
### T cell reinvigoration correlates with tumor burden
 - antigen burden key determinant of exhaustion severity and reinvigoration by PD-1 blockade, want to test if that is true here in melanoma
 - evidence of pre-existing CD8 T cell response related to tumor burden, augmented by PD-1 blockade
### Reinvigoration/tumor ratio affects clinical outcome
 - perhaps larger baseline immune responses correlate with clinical response
 - however, higher pre-treatment Ki67 (proliferation) levels in PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells was associated with poor prognosis
 - rather, perhaps a larger baseline immune response may reflect a higher tumor burden that is itself indicates poor prognosis
 - Ki67 levels don't correlate with clinical outcome alone, so rather than reinvigoration magnitude, perhaps its the exhausted T cell:tumor burden ratio that better predicts clinical response
## Discussion
 - most patients have an on-target immunological, detectable effect of PD-1 blockade on CD8 T cells
 - see exhausted T cells as major target of PD-1 blockade (reinvigoration)
 - most patients have a single peak of PD-1 blockade-induced immune reinvigoration despite on-going treatment
 - responding exhausted T cells in blood contain TCR clonotypes shared with tumor infiltrating T cells
 - ratio of exhausted T cell reinvigoration to tumor burden predicts clinical response
# T cell mediated autoimmune disease due to low-affinity crossreactivity to common microbial peptides
## Summary
 - microbial peptide common to several major bacterial classes can induce MS-like disease in humanized mice by crossreacting with TCR that also recognizes peptide from myelin basic protein (candidate MS autoantigen)
 - crossreactivity due to structural mimicry of binding hotspot shared by self and microbial antigens rather than degenerate TCR recognition
 - autoreactive TCR binding affinity much lower than affinity for microbial (mimic) peptide
## Introduction
 - MS associated with 3 different MHCII alleles of HLA-DR2 haplotype in northern Europeans: DRB1*1501, DRB5*0101 (encode β chains of DR2b and DR2a molecules, respectively), DQB1*0602 (encodes β chain of HLA-DQ6.2)
 - HLA-DR, not HLA-DQ, implicated in MS susceptibility, HLA-DR restricted T cell mediated autoimmunity to myelin antigens
 - **mechanism: self-reactive TCRs require affinity low enough to escape negative selection in thymus but high enough for activation in periphery**
 - molecular mimicry hypothesis: some T cells respond to epitope derived from infectious agent can crossreact with self antigen that shares sequence/structural homology with microbial peptide
## Discussion
 - **does molecular mimicry result from inherent degeneracy in TCR binding mode (promiscuity) or a structural equivalence between pMHC surfaces presented for TCR recognition? kind of both but seems to lean towards structural equivalence with hotspot mimicry (small number of key residues in TCR binding site rather than high-affinity structural affinity inwhich all binding features would need to be replicated)**, perhaps helps explain why it has been difficult to incriminate specific individual infections in autoimmune disease development (degeneracy in crossreactivity?)
# T cell receptor β variable gene polymorphism predicts immune-related adverse events during checkpoint blockade immunotherapy
 - TRBV gene polymorphisms implicated in autoimmunity, perhaps irAEs too
 - find TRBV allele haplotype protective against severe irAEs
 - **T-cells with autoreactive TCRs that escape thymic negative selection and persist as deactivated T-cells in the periphery may be re-activated by ICIs to mediate irAEs**
 - **perhaps ICIs reduce efficacy of thymic negative selection, but doesn't that occur in infancy?**
# T cell receptor convergence is an indicator of antigen-specific T cell response in cancer immunotherapies
## Abstract
 - TCR convergence: same AA sequence, different nt sequence
 - **link between antigen specificity and convergence stronger than link between antigen specificity and expansion**
## Result
### TCR convergence is different from publicity
 - degeneracy: number of distinct clonotypes (nt seq) encoding TCR within sample, 1 means non-convergent, > 1 means convergent
 - see ~5% of TCRs as convergent, mostly degeneracy of 2 (some 3, higher rare, i.e. mostly convergent just due to 2 unique nt seqs encoding them)
 - **shorter CDR3s appear to be more conducive to convergence**
 - convergence/degeneracy not affected by  V gene usage
 - **convergent TCRs favor polar neutral AAs and acidic AAs, like tyrosine, serine, glutamic acid, alkaline and hydrophobic AAs less favorable for convergent TCRs**
 - TCR degeneracy not due to codon degeneracy, arginine, leucine, and serine all encoded by 6 codons but serine moreso than leucine and arginine enriched in convergent TCRs
 - public TCRs generated from V(D)J recombination biases, might target common antigens like viral epitopes
 - TCRs targeting cancer neoantigens mostly private, so higher TMB maybe more private TCRs (more neoantigens)
 - **TCR convergence and publicity seem to diverge by TMB, overlap decreases with increasing TMB**
### Convergent TCRs are more likely to be antigen specific
 - antigen specific here really means antigen experienced
 - moreso than expanded T cells' receptors
### TCR convergence is associated with the clinical outcome of ICB treatment
 - even after adjusting for covariates of TCR diversity, clonality
## Discussion
 - CD8 TCRs more convergent than CD4 TCRs, perhaps due to greater impact of antigen selection on CD8s
# T cell receptor repertoire as a predictor of immune-related adverse events in renal cell carcinoma
 - median proportion of top 10 unique reads in TCR repertoire higher in more severe irAEs (grade 3 vs. grade 2) in RCC patients receiving ICB, so **more clonal repertoire with more severe irAEs**
# T cell repertoire analysis and metrics of diversity and clonality
 - **TCRαβ heterodimer disulfide linked, each chain has constant and variable domain, 3 CDRs per chain so CDR1-3 α and β**
 - **CDR3 product of junctional diversity, most variable**
 - **TCR-pMHC binding rather low-affinity, degenerate (many TCRs recognize same peptide and many peptides recognized by same TCR)**
 - **CDR1-2 contact MHC and CDR3 contacts peptide is the general rule, but CDR1α also contacts peptide and CDR3β doesn't contact peptide too much**
## Diversity meaures
 - richness refers to number of unique TCR sequences, evenness refers to distribution spectrum of these TCR sequences (relative abundances)
 - diversity relates to level of uncertainty that TCR sequence sorted from reportoire would belong to a certain T cell clone (unique TCR sequence), very diverse indicating a high uncertainty that random TCR seq would come from a randomly selected T cell in pool
 - effective number of species i.e. Hill number yields effective number of distinct clonotypes (# of equally abundant seqs that would produce given diversity value), derived by summing all frequencies of sequences and the nraising to (1/(1-α)) power?
 - α sets sensitivity of diversity index to species abundances in system, when α = 0 all species are weighted equally so diversity = richness (# of unique sequences, independent of/ignore abundances)
 - Shannon entropy: order (α) of 1, negative sum of (frequency of seq * log of frequency of seq), 0 means monoclonal, max (log of number of unique sequences) means evenely distributed TCR sequences, encounters higher variation upon addition of low frequency clones than Gini-Simpson index and is more sensitive to undersampling than Gini coefficient
 - Gini coefficinet: rangs from 0 (max diversity, equal abundance) to 1 (high clonality of 1 sequence)
 - Gini-Simpson index: order (α) of 2, 0 means monoclonal, 1 means polyclonal with equivalent representation of all clones, barely affected by increasing number of unique TCRs in repertoire (unlike Shannon entropy)
 - Pielou's index (evenness measure): clonal evenness refers to clonal diversity, 1 - Pielou's index is often used and here 0 means maximally diverse and 1 means monoclonal (very affected by undersampling i.e. unseen TCR seq issue as not all from population analyzed)
 - Gini coefficient: inequality measure, distinct from Gini-Simpson index, 0 means maximal diversity, high value means monoclonal
# T cell repertoire diversity: friend or foe for protective antitumor response?
 - **CD3 is signal transducing subunit for TCR**
 - immune changes in aging: fewer naive T cells able to respond to new antigens, higher representation of more differentiated effector/memory T cells
 - **high TCR diversity/richness/evenness (all same here, highly polyclonal synonyms) in blood associted with good ICB outcome**
# T cell repertoire in peripheral blood as a potential biomarker for predicting response to concurrent cetuximab and nivolumab in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
 - TCRB chain profiling
 - increased baseline TCR sequence diversity associated with ICB response
# T cells specific for alpha-myosin drive immunotherapy related myocarditis
 - mice (*Pdcd1-/-Ctla4+/-*, recapitulates features of ICB myocarditis in humans)
 - CD8<sup>+</sup> dominant cell population in immune infiltrate in heart and drive myocarditis (anti-CD8 antibody rescues mice)
 - alpha-myosin antigen target of three MHCI restricted TCRs from mice with myocarditis
 - **peripheral blood from three humans with ICI-myocarditis were expanded by alpha-myosin peptides, these alpha-myosin expanded T cells shared TCR clonotypes with diseased heart and skeletal muscle infiltrates**
# T cell tolerance: central and peripheral
## Summary
 - central tolerance: clonal deletion and diversion (Treg differentiation) control self-reactive T cells in the thymus
 - peripheral tolerance: anergy (T cells becoming functionally unresponsive) and deletion of self-reactive T cells occurs outside thymus in cases where central tolerance fails to control self-reactivity and self-reactive T cells encounter self-antigens (not all antigens T cells need to be tolerant of are expressed in thymus)
## T cell differentiation
 - T lymphocytes arise from circulating bone-marrow-derived progenitors going to thymus
 - T cell lineage commitment and expansion
 - TCR gene rearrangement gives rise to γδ or αβ progenitors at CD4 and CD8 double-negative stage
 - fraction of αβ committed double-negative cells give rise to many CD4 and CD8 double-positive thymocytes
 - somatic recombination of TCR genes results in broad repertoire of αβ TCRs with random specificities
 - double-positive thymocytes expressing TCRs that have no/low affinity for self-peptide-MHC complexes die by neglect
 - double-positive thymocytes expressing TCRs that have intermediate affinity for self-peptide-MHC differentiate to CD4 or CD8 single-positive thymocytes (positive selection) in the cortex, single-positive thymocytes go to the medulla
 - double-positive thymocytes expressing TCRs that have high affinity for self-peptide-MHC pose a threat to self-tolerance, so they undergo clonal deletion, diversion to Treg lineage, anergy, or receptor editing (secondary gene rearrangements of TCRα loci)
# T cell tolerant fraction as a predictor of immune-related adverse events
 - tolerant fraction characterized according to productive/non-productive TCRB sequences, **not sure how this relates, I understand their hypothesis that more tolerant T cells would lead to lower irAE risk but I don't understand how tolerant fraction can be estimated from productive fraction, productive just means it can function and bind some antigen not necessarily self/foreign?**
 - **so they say "In healthy subjects, we considered TRB sequences that are expressed to be tolerant; otherwise, the subject would not be healthy" which does make sense but what about abundance? healthy people have rare self-reactive T cells that's known I think**
# TCR contact residue hydrophobicity is a hallmark of immunogenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes
 - relative hydrophobicity of TCR contact residues enriched in immunogenic MHC I epitopes in human and murine MHCs in both self and foreign immunogenic epitopes
 - **highly polar amino acids underrepresented in immunogenic epitopes vs. non-immunogenic epitopes, hydrophobic amino acids overrepresented**
 - **most antigens in this immunogenic dataset are from viruses, lower GC genomic content, so more hydrophobic residues come from that, so perhaps TCRs exploit this to generally recognize pathogens by hydrophobic peptides**
 - **antigen presentation might also favor hydrophobic regions, for example hydrophobic regions enhance degradation and MHC presentation perhaps, immunogenic epitopes biased towards center of antigen where hydrophobic core is for cytosolic proteins**
# TCR convergence in individuals treated with immune checkpoint inhibition for cancer
## Abstract
 - TCR convergence: expansion of T cells having TCRs of shared antigen specificity (same amino acid sequence) but different TCR nucleotide sequences, perhaps due to sustained antigen exposure causing selection of all T cells with the same antigen specificity (same amino acid sequence TCR) but different TCR nucleotide sequences, calculated here as frequency of unique TCR nucleotide sequences (clones) sharing variable gene (excluding allele info) and CDR3 amino acid sequence with at least one other clone
## Introduction
 - TMB may fail as checkpoint inhibitor response predictor in cases where tumors have neoantigens not from non-synonymous mutations, **i.e. from frameshift, splice site mutations maybe?**
 - substitution sequencing errors might be false positives for TCR convergence detection
## Results
 - elevated TCR convergence in baseline peripheral blood of those who respond to CTLA-4 blockade for cancer
## Discussion
 - **TCRs can have alpha or beta chain dominance, or codominance, in terms of contribution to antigen specificity**, one not contributing as much to specificity would mean it just plays an accessory/stabilizing role
# TCR-ESM: employing protein language embeddings to predict TCR-peptice-MHC binding
 - trained on paired alpha beta TCR data
# TCR sequencing and cloning methods for repertoire analysis and isolation of tumor-reactive TCRs
## Abstract
 - SEQTR (SEQuencing T cell Receptor): combines *in vitro* transcription and single primer pair TCR amplification, combine with PCR to amplify TCR from bulk population, tumor-specific TCR identification and cloning
 - TCR RNA expression doesn’t affect clonotype quantification, **meaning that you can rather reliably infer clonotype frequencies from RNA levels, previously thought to be biased by different RNA abundances**
## Introduction
 - TCR repertoire refers to assembly of TCR sequences
## Other TCRseq methods
### Multiplex PCR
 - uses pool of primers that targets all V and J germline genes to amplify entire V(D)J rearrangements, or specifically CDR3 region
 - can introduce amplification biases due to differential primer efficiency
### 5' RACE
 - rapid amplification of cDNA ends
 - uses a single primer that targets known C-gene region of mRNA transcripts
 - associated with poor efficiency of template switch that adds 5' adapter in only 20-60% of RNA molecules
## RNA-based assays allow clonotype quantification
### DNA-based assays
 - DNA is more stable and present at fixed copy numbers (easier quantification)
 - DNA from irrelevant V and J segments not part of rearranged TCR sequence is still present, introducing noise
 - DNA includes both TCRβ alleles while only one is usually present (allelic exclusion)
### RNA-based assays
 - RNA reflects what T cell expresses
 - large RNA copy number increases sensitivity
 - RNA is compatible with UMIs to correct amplification and sequencing errors
 - RNA is thought to bias clonotype quantification because of variations in TCR expression among cells, so they perform scTCR-seq to look at TCR mRNA and clonotype (TCR expressing same TCR at protein level) frequencies in same assay
### scTCR-seq
 - tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in melanoma patients
 - T cells express 10 TCRα and 21 TCRβ (presumably unique) mRNA molecules on average (**just 1 per cell though right, so in each patient on average see 10 and 21 unique TCRα and TCRβ mRNA molecules, respectively, on average?**)
 - TCR expression varied 2-fold around median in 70% of cells
 - intra-clonotype TCR expression heterogeneity similar to inter-cell heterogeneity, so TCR expression is not clonotype dependent
 - different T cell states express TCRs to similar degrees (activated cells' TCR expression slightly lower)
# TCR-sequencing in cancer and autoimmunity: barcodes and beyond
## Summary
 - since T cells have unique TCRs (stably maintained through cell divisions), TCR barcodes T cell through migration, differentiation, proliferation
 - limitations: unable to infer antigen specificity from TCR sequence
## Glossary
 - **clonal replacement: recruitment of less dysfunctional peripheral T cell clonotypes to tumor that were not detectable in tumor prior to PD-1 blockade, i.e. from tumor draining lymph node, more important in ICI than previously thought**
 - **clonal revival: replenishment of highly dysfunctional T cell clones in tumor with new, less dysfunctional T cells (perhaps from periphery, local expansion within tumor) that can be novel clonotypes (i.e. clonal replacement) or clonotypes pre-existing in tumor**
 - **clone (set of T cells that are clonal progeny due to shared clonotype and host) vs. clonotype (paired α and β TCR nucleotide sequence of a T cell)**
 - **MHC haplotype: combination of MHC alleles found in a single individual**
 - neoadjuvant: treatment (surgery, radiation) given before definitive, curative treatment
 - neoantigens: antigens from somatic mutations in tumors
 - **private (unique to a single individual) vs. public (found in multiple individuals) TCR sequences**
 - TCR fingerprint: family of peptides recognized by single TCR
## Single cell TCR seq: bringing high-throughput single cell precision to T cell immunology
 - naive T cells trafic through spleen, lymph nodes, blood in search of APCs to initiate T cell activation
 - T cell activation requires antigen-specific signal via TCR interacting with peptide bound to MHC (pMHC) on APC and co-stimulatory signal delivered by CD28 co-stimulatory receptor on T cell binding to B7 ligands on APC
 - inflammatory signals promote full T cell effector differentition, leading to extensive prolifertion, transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming, and production of effector molecules (i.e. secretion of inflammatory cytokines, cytotoxicity)
 - **affinity of TCR for pMHC can affect propensity to become effector or memory T cell**
 - **naive T cells are very plastic, one clone can lead to diverse cell states**
 - can use *in vivo* deuterium labeling to mark proliferating cells, for example to show that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory cells derive from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that extensively divided during first 2 weeks of infection and have a doubling time of > 450 days
 - **challenges of scTCRseq and scRNAseq: ambiguous antigen specificities, polyspecific nature of TCR binding to pMHC, presence of both antigen-specific T cells and bystander T cells in tissues of interest, statistical inference issues related to sample size**
 - polyspecific nature of TCR-pMHC binding: TCRs able to recognize multiple pMHCs, very difficult to predict binding
 - **just because a T cell is antigen specific doesn't mean it is functional (secreting effector cytokines, killing cells), just because a T cell is a bystander (non-antigen specific, i.e. in tumors T cells not binding tumor-associated antigens, perhaps a virus-specific T cell in a cancer associated with viral infection like HPV or hepatitis B, bystander infiltration here good for prognosis) doesn't mean it doesn't contribute to an immune response**
## Methods for tracking T cells of interest
 - virtually all naive T cells have different TCR sequences
 - combinations of V, D, J segments in humans allows 10<sup>14</sup> to 10<sup>19</sup> possible TCR sequences, though the observed number is around 10<sup>8</sup> likely due to T cell developmental constraints (failure to undergo positive selection, negative selection)
 - **T cell activation can induce ~15-20 divisions, expanding number of antigen-specific T cells ~50,000 fold (likely upper limit of clonal expansion)**, clonal expansion in autoimmunity and cancer likely lower due to suboptimal T cell activtion (low-affinity antigens, low inflammation)
 - T cells of a single clonotype are rare in peripheral blood
### Antigen-directed methods for detecting T cells of interest
 - antigen-directed methods: identification based on T cell's ability to bind/recognize specific antigens (like tetramer assay in which soluble pMHC molecules are complexed to streptavidin core labeled with fluorescent marker or DNA barcode)
 - **limitations of tetramer assay: antigen must be known, limited to number of known antigens trackable at one time (low throughput), tetramers often inefficient at detecting TCRs with low affinity for pMHC (perhaps significant for cancer, autoimmunity), tetramers can only be used in individuals with MHC haplotypes for which there are tetramers available**
 - can also use antigen stimulation *in vitro* and then sort activated T cells (by activation marker or expansion level), but can't really phenotype these cells before stimulation
 - Tconv refers to conventional, non-Treg T cell
### TCR-directed methods for detecting T cells of interest
 - **TCR sequence generated through V(D)J recombination during T cell development in thymus, random recombination of *V*, *D*, *J* segments for β chain and α chain (just *V* and *J* for α though) of each TCR**
 - bulk TCR seq often collects 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> TCRs per sample, scTCRseq often lower (100-1000 TCRs/sample), skewed distribution of clones (long tail of unexpanded clones that represent minimal fraction of true repertoire)
### Using the TCR as a barcode in cancer
 - limitation: some baseline level of clonal expansion may be needed for TCR sequence to be useful due to detection limits for identifying rare/unexpanded populations by scTCRseq
 - barcode method may have more utility in immunologically 'hot' tumors (high mutational burden, high CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration, high inflammation)
### Using the TCR as a barcode in autoimmunity
 - antigen persists for some autoimmune diseases (RA, MS) but decreases over time for others (T1D insulin-producing β cells, so pathogenic T cell population likely contracts with loss of APCs)
## Using TCR analyses to inform on mechanisms of antitumor immunity following PD-1 immunotherapy
 - pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, glioblastoma don't respond well to PD-1 blockade
### Anatomical site of action of PD-1 inhibitors: tumor vs lymph node
 - are antitumor immune responses of PD-1 inhibition driven by reinvigorated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell within tumor bed or by newly recruited tumor specific T cells (i.e. from tumor draining lymph node)? **perhaps more the latter than previously thought**
 - can use S1P agonist FTY720 to block T cell migration to study effect of recruited T cells from tumor draining lymph nodes
## Beyond a barcode: how does the TCR sequence impact T cell fate?
 - TCR hydrophobicity, electrostatic charges allows good prediction of if T cell is TIL or from adjacent normal tissue
## Conclusions
 - advanced melanoma, non small cell lung cancer are immunologically hot
 - repertoire of antigens driving responses for cancer, autoimmunity, irAEs largely unknown, major challenge
 - many autoimmune diseases feature risk polymorphisms in *HLA* genes that constrain TCR repertoire during thymic selection
# Temporal single cell tracing reveals clonal revival and expansion of precursor exhausted T cells during anti-PD-1 therapy in lung cancer
## Abstract
 - **increased levels of precursor exhausted T cells (Texp) in responsive tumors after treatment**, low expression of coinhibitory molecules and high expression of *GZMK*
 - nonresponsive tumors failed to accumulate Texp cells
 - **Texp cells unlikely to be derived from reinvigoration of terminally exhausted cells but rather accumulate by local expansion and/or replenishment by peripheral T cells with new and pre-existing clonotypes, clonal revival**
## Main
### Characterization of T cells pre- and post-PD-1 blockade by scRNA-seq
 - 36 patients with NSCLC
 - increase in expanded Th1-like cells in responsive tumor
 - Tex importance depends on pre-treatment terminal Tex infiltration: low terminal Tex baseline infiltration responsive tumors had PD-1 blockade increasing these cells (increased infiltration or expansion of these cells, consistent with increased exhausted-like T cells with ICB), but high terminal Tex baseline infiltration responsive tumors had opposite pattern (decreased frequency with ICB)
### Local expansion of pre-existing Texp cells
 - local expansion of pre-existing Texp cells drives Texp accumulation, as does clonal revival (from periphery)
# The altertions in peripheral lymphocyte subsets predict the efficacy and prognosis of immune checkpoint inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma
 - CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell percentage increases after ICI, B cell percentage decreases
# The cancer-immunity cycle: indication, genotype, and immunotype
## cancer immunity cycle
 - release of cancer cell antigens (cancer cell death)
 - cancer antigen presentation (DCs/APCs)
 - priming/activation of T cells by APCS
 - trafficking of T cells to tumors
 - infiltration of T cells into tumors (past stromal barrier)
 - recognition of cancer cells by T cells
 - killing of cancer cells
 - release of more cancer cell antigens (restart cycle)
## immunotypes
 - immunotypes: immunological phenotypes of cancers
 - inflammed (abundant immune infiltrates, untreated melanoma generally)
 - excluded (infiltrates limited to stroma as opposed to parenchyma, untreated colon cancer generally)
 - desert (no infiltrates, untreated prostate cancer generally)
## T cell exhaustion
 - exhausted T cells accumulate when amount of antigen exceeds ability for clearance by antigen-specific T cells
 - characterized by increased expression of coinhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT), these receptors also mark T cell activation
 - blocking coinhibitory receptors (i.e. ICB) can reinvigorate exhausted T cells but exhaustion is a difficult to reverse, altered epigenetic state
# The changing landscape of naive T cell receptor repertoire with human aging
 - aging associated with loss of thymus productivity, yet naive T cells still maintain abundance by division in periphery for many years
 - **shorter CDR3 β, less added N nucleotides within CDR3 β with aging**
 - **increase in publicness of CD4 but not CD8 naive T cell repertoires with aging**
 - **increased clonality with aging, as expected with clonal expansion over time**
# The diverse functions of the PD1 inhibitory pathway
## Key points
 - PD1: inhibitory receptor expressed by all T cells during activation (also B cells, NKs, some myeloid cells), regulates effector functions, often high and sustained expression in persistent antigen exposure (chronic infections, cancer) and can limit protective immunity in these cases, limits autoreactive T cells
 - PDL1: expressed broadly, can shield organs from autoimmune attack
## Abstract
 - early in the activation process, coinhibitory 'checkpoints' (like PD1) are induced to regulate T cells (counteract activation program)
## Main
 - costimulatory signals: CD28 on T cells and CD80 (B7.1) and/or CD86 (B7.2) on APCs (for example, there are other costimulatory signals)
 - CTLA-4 is one of the first negative regulators induced during T cell activation (competes with CD28 for ligands CD80/86)
 - PD1 (PDCD1, CD279) expressed during T cell activation (so PD1 marks effector T cells too not just exhausted T cells), engages ligands PDL1 (CD274, B7-H1) and/or PDL2 (CD273, B7-DC) expressed by same cell engaging T cell with pMHCI
 - effector T cells must mass these inhibitory checkpoints in order to exert full effector function
 - PD1 can also trigger phosphatases (SHP2) to counteract positive signaling between TCR-pMHCI and CD28/CD80/86
 - downstream of TCR-pMHC is transcription factor activation (like AP-1, NFAT, NK-kappa B)
 - PD1 can increase expression of transcription factors like BATF to counteract T cell activation transcriptional program
 - PDL1 can also bind CD80
 - after T cell activation, if antigen is cleared, memory T cells form and PD1 expression levels decrease (PD1 expression remains high if antigen persists and T cell exhaustion can develop)
# The good and the bad of T cell crossreactivity: challenges and opportunities for novel therapeutics in autoimmunity and cancer
 - each T cell expresses ~10,000 copies of TCR on cell surface
 - **peptide binding to MHC allelic products subject to specific rules, i.e. anchor/preferred residues in peptide for specific MHC alleles just like anchor/prefered peptide residues for specific TCRs**
 - **modes of crossreactivity: induced fit (change in CDR3 loop conformation), differential TCR docking (different docking orientation), structural degeneracy (weak TCR-pMHC interaction), molecular mimicry (similar structural/chemical features), antigen-dependent tuning of pMHC flexibility (ligand freedom on MHC)**
 - crossreactivity common for very similar peptides (1-2 residue changes)
 - crossreactivity likely tuned by coreceptors (inhibitory/activating) and adhesion molecules expressed by T cell at given time
 - **TCR conceivably could recognize ~ 1 million peptides, crossreactive peptides likely often better agonists than original one that activated T cell, but few (~1%) of peptides are actually presented on MHC, so probably crossreactivity estimate closer to 1 in ~10,000**
 - **molecular mimicry: weakly crossreactive T cells activated through recognition of infection pathogens and then crossreact with self antigens, memory T cells can be stimulated by lower concentrations of peptides than naive T cells, related to fact that infections often precipitate autoimmunity**
 - tumor-associated antigens (i.e. not neoantigens) are poorly immunogenic due to thymic negative selection of highly self-reactive T cells
 - antigen-reactive T cell fraction in peripheral immune naive repertoire very low, ~ 1 in 100,000 T cells
 - **interest in designing peptides that can activate T cells to be crossreactive against tumor associated antigens to improve immunogenicity (usually weak to tumor associated antigens)**
 - **some parts of body are immune privileged and lack HLA expression, like placenta and testis**
# The graft-versus-leukemia effect in AML
 - allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) commonly used in cancer care, most potent anti-leukemic therapy in AML (acute myeloid leukemia) patients
 - donor T cells (and maybe other immune cells) eliminate residual leukemia cells after radio/chemotherapy = graft-versus-leukemia response
 - donor alloimmune responses can also be directed against healthy tissue = graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)
 - graft-versus-leukemia and graft-versus-host often co-occur
# The IL-33/ST2 pathway: therapeutic target and novel biomarker
 - IL-33 is in IL-1 family of cytokines
 - ST2 (IL-33 receptor) is present in multiple isoforms including membrane-bound ST2L and soluble sST2 (may be decoy for IL-33)
 - ST2 participates in activation of antigen-primed Th2 cells
 - ST2 implicated in inflammatory conditions
# The JAK-STAT pathway as a therapeutic strategy in cancer patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis: a narrative review
 - JAK-STAT inhibition helps ICI colitis, perhaps through modulation of CD8 Trms
# The landscape of immune checkpoint-related long non-coding RNAs in core regulatory circuitry reveals implications for immunoregulation and immunotherapy responses
 - lncRNAs such as MIR155HG and ADAMTS9-AS2 play central roles in immune regulation
# The loss of CTLA-4 leads to massive lymphoproliferation and fatal multiorgan tissue destruction, revealing a critical negative regulatory role of CTLA-4
 - previous studies had suggested both positive and negative roles for CTLA-4 in T cell activation, **not sure if any activation roles are still thought to be true**
 - CTLA-4 mouse KO leads to lymphoproliferative disease, lymphocyte infiltration into tissue, tissue destruction, severe myocarditis and pancreatitis, death by 3-4 weeks of age
# The nexus of dynamic T cell states and immune checkpoint blockade therapy in the periphery and tumor microenvironment
## Abstract
 - *de novo* priming of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells in peripheral blood occurs throughout course of ICB (rather than reinvigoration of pre-ICB-existing tumor infiltrating exhausted lymphocytes), possible that local expansion of antigen-specific T cells within tumor also important though
## Introduction
 - VISTA is an immune checkpoint regulator, **that I haven't heard of before**, expressed on tumor-infiltrating leukocytes and myeloid cells, suppresses T cells
 - agonists for co-stimulators, like ICOS, also being tested
 - higher intratumor PD-L1 levels correlates with higher ICB benefit, but patients with PD-1 negative tumors can still sometimes respond to ICBs (and conversely high PD-L1 expressing tumors can be ICB resistant), PD-L1 expression also varies spatially and temporally, so we need more response markers besides PD-L1 ezpression
 - using tumor biopsies to identify predictive response markers: hard to biopsy metastases, tumors are heterogeneous (sampling error), hard to obtain consecutive biopsies over ICB course
 - peripheral blood profiling: less invasive, easier longitudinally
## Immune checkpoint blockades
 - CTLA-4 blocks early T cell activation via interruption of costimulatory CD28, failure of CTLA-4 blockade to treat cancer may mean that **early T cell response is intact in cancer patients**
 - PD-1 (on T cells) interaction with PD-L1 (on tumor cells) inhibits T cells in tumor microenvironment
 - **tumor type matters for ICB response: melanoma/NSCLC have higher response rates, colon/endometrium cancers do not respond well to ICB (although those with high microsatellite instability and MMRd repsond well), tumor burden is a good predictor of ICB response (neoantigen generation to elicit antitumor immunity)**
 - **ovarian cancers ICB resistant, not known why (perhaps TIM-3 checkpoint), despite tumor-infiltrating leukocytes present in most ovarian cancer patients (or perhaps these are bystanders reactive to viruses rather than tumor antigens)**
## T cell receptor repertoire analysis and its application to dissect the mechanisms of ICB therapies
 - tumor infiltrating leukocytes may predict patient survival, ICBs originally thought to activate tumor infiltrating leukocytes, but **in responsive patients peripheral compartment is a major source of T cells activated by ICB and majority of pre-existing intratumoral T cells are terminally exhausted and refractory to ICB**
 - some pre-exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumor microenvironment (precursors of exhausted T cells, Tpex) may contribute to ICB repsonse
 - **ICB-induced clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells may be indicated by a decrease in TCR diversity**
 - **conversely, ICB-induced migration of T cells to the tumor may increase the diversity of TCR repertoire**
## Overview of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltrates in human tumor microenvironment
 - T cell infiltrates in tumor microenvironment can be tumor-reactive (CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) or bystander virus-reactive (CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, don't contribute to antitumor immunity or respond to ICB)
 - > 80% of tumor infiltrating leukocytes in ovarian tumors are bystanders, perhaps related to the lethality and ICB resistance of ovarian cancer
 - **CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets: naive (not yet exposed to antigenic stimulation, CCR7, LEF1, IL7R, TCF7, SELL), effector (stimulated by antigens, acquired cytotoxicity, perforin 1, granzymes, NK cell granule 7, CX3CR1, KLRG1, FCGR3A), memory (subset of Teff convert into resting memory that can generate many Teff cells upon restimulation by cognate antigens)**
 - **central memory vs. effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells: Tcm abundant in spleen, blood, lymph, highly proliferative upon reactivation, lymphatic homing markers (CD62L, CCR7, GPR183, CD27/28), Tem abundant in spleen and blood, highly cytotoxic upon reactivation, granzymes, KLRG1, CXCR4, GCGR3A, lack CD62L, there's also tissue resident memory T cells (Trm) that are CD103<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup> and excluded from circulation**
 - tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells eventually become exhausted due to chronic antigen stimulation, increased inhibitory receptors (PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG3, TIM-3), reduced effector functions (reduced IL-2, TNF, IFN-γ production)
### CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell dysfunction is a progressive state within tumor microenvironment
 - earlier stage tumors likely have T cells on path to terminal exhaustion, late stage tumors likely have terminally exhausted T cells
 - no drugs to reverse cellular state of terminally exhausted Tex cells, need to manipulate epigenetics/metabolism
### Characterization of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumor microenvironment during ICB therapies
 - PD-1 blockade may **transiently** reduce/revert dysfunction of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cells in tumor microenvironment
## Characterization of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood during ICBs
 - lymph nodes primary location for antigen presentation cells to activate antigen-specific T cells (**less exhausted than those in tumor microenvironment**) that can then migrate and infiltrate into tumor to complement effector population
 - **some circulating PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells share TCR sequences with T cells in TME, and this frequency predicts ICB response**
# The promising link among tumor mutational burden, immune-related adverse events, and immune checkpoint inhibitors efficacy in SCLC
 - letter in response to findings of irAEs correlating with ICB efficacy, perhaps related to association between irAE occurence and tumor mutational burden (also correlates with ICB efficacy)
 - **can see same clonotypes of T cells reactive against tumor and self in irAEs**
 - **higher tumor mutational burden and therefore antigenicity increase probability of crossreactivity because there are more distinct clonotypes of activated T cells and therefore more chances for a crossreactive clonotype to induce irAEs**, alternative hypothesis is that high tumor mutational burden correlates with ICI response therefore patients live longer and are more likely to eventually experience irAEs
 - another caveat: < 1% of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants in expressed genes result in detectable CD4/CD8 positive T cell reactivity in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, **would any be predicted in periphery?**, **frameshift mutations much more likely to lead to neoantigens**
# The relationship between hydrophobicity and drug-protein binding in human serum albumin: a quartz crystal microbalance study
 - positive correlation between drug hydrophobicity and binding strength to human serum albumin, **perhaps in contrast to hypothesis of increased crossreactivity from more hydrophobic TCRs, assuming increased crossreactivity means lower strength binding for each or a lower possible maximum...**
# The role of immune checkpoints in antitumor response: a potential antitumor immunotherapy
 - tumor cells primarily employ altered expression of HLA to avoid immune recognition and antitumor immune response (induced by strong immune pressure of CTLs leadin g to development of tumor variants with deregulated expression of classical and non-classical HLA-I molecules to evade immune system)
 - IL-2 and IL-2R expressed by T cells following dual signal activation (pMHC-TCR and CD80/86 on APC with CD28 on T cell) to regulate clonal expansion
## Main immune checkpoints
 - PD-1: regulates T lymphocyte activity in tissues/tumors, expressed on APCS, monocytes, NK/NKT cells, macrophages, activated T cells, B cells, ligands are PD-L1/2
 - CTLA-4: receptor homologous to CD28, inhibits T lymphocytes by competing with CD28 for binding, expressed on FoxP3-induced Tregs, activated T cells, ligands are CD80/86 (B7-1/2)
 - HLA-G: HLA class I molecule, ligands are ILT-2/4, KIR2DL4
# The role of immune checkpoints in cardiovascular disease
 - cardiovascular irAEs: atherosclerosis, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy
 - inhibition of vascular inhibitor checkpoints is associated with increased atherosclerotic burden and plaque instability (ICs protect against atherosclerosis by inhibiting T cell activity and cytokine production, promoting Treg differentiation, inducing T cell exhaustion)
 - PD-L1 on endothelial cells might promote plaque stability by reducing apoptosis and increasing expression of tight junction molecules
 - in heart, ICs downregulate immune response to protect against cardiac injury by reducing T cell activity and migration (inhibiton of ICs can induce T cell-mediated myocarditis)
 - JAK/STAT involved in both PD-L1/2 and CD80/86 signaling, related to irAEs perhaps (JAK inhibitors for autoimmune disorders may be useful for irAE treatment)
# The role of metabolic dysfunction in T cell exhaustion during chronic viral infection
 - dysfunction of T cell metabolism contributes to exhaustion
 - naive (Th0) and memory T cells rely mostly on OXPHOS and FA oxidation for energy, metabolism reprogrammed upon antigen recognition (generates energy but also fuels intermediates for nucleotide, amino acid, and FA synthesis and mitochondrial function, all important for T cell proliferation, differentiation, function), enhanced glycolysis ("Warburg effect", lactic acid fermentation rather than TCA despite normoxic conditions which is less efficient ATP production wise but faster kinetically, glycolysis also helps create intermediates for biomolecule synthesis) important reprogramming during CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and functioning
 - downregulation of glycolysis, augmented lipolysis and FA oxidation in exhausted T cells
# The role of single cell profiling and deep immunophenotyping in understanding immune therapy cardiotoxicity
 - review
 - bulk RNAseq study: upregulation of proinflammatory genes in myocarditis group, also downregulation of homeostasis genes
 - scRNAseq in mice: macrophages 60% of cardiac immune cell population, type 17 helper T cells with upregulated Hif1a main T cell population in acute myocarditis phase
# The role of tissue-resident memory T cells as mediators for response and toxicity in immunotherapy-treated melanoma - two sides of the same coin?
 - 
# The role of type I conventional dendritic cells in cancer immunity
 - cDC1 = conventional type 1 DC, express BDCA3, CLEC9A/DNGR-1, XCR1
# The role of type-2 conventional dendritic cells in the regulation of tumor immunity
 - cDC1s dedicated to activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, cross-present tumor-derived antigens for priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
 - cDC2s heterogeneous, present exogenous antigens to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for initiation of T helper cell differentiation
# The side effect registry immuno-oncology (SERIO) - a tool for systematic analysis of immunotherapy-induced side effects
 - 1300 irAE cases from 58 centers worldwide
 - 44 publications

# The somatically generated portion of T cell receptor CDR3α contributes to the MHC allele specificity of the T cell receptor
 - mice
 - **positive selection-induced MHC bias of TCRs affected both by germline encoded elements of TCRα and β chain, also affected by non-germline encoded portions of CDR3α**
 - **positive selection: bias of TCRs towards peptides bound to allele of MHC to which T cells were exposed to in thymus**
 - **peptides presented to T cells in thymus also controlled by MHC allele, so MHC allele specificity of positive selection might be dictated by peptide as well rather than just the MHC protein**
# The structural basis of T cell receptor (TCR) activation: an enduring enigma
 - the T-cell receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex is composed of a diverse αβ TCR heterodimer noncovalently associated with the invariant CD3 dimers CD3ϵγ, CD3ϵδ, and CD3ζζ
 - the TCR mediates the recognition of pMHC, whereas the CD3 molecules transduce activation signals to the T cell
 - early T cell activation (how TCR engagement by pMHC is communicated to CD3) process remains a mystery
 - **there can be 100,000 pMHCs on an APC**
 - **CDR1/2 are encoded within the TCR V segments, whereas CDR3 is formed by DNA recombination involving juxtaposition of Vα and Jα segments for α chain genes and Vβ, D, and Jβ segments for β chain genes**
 - early T cell activation model mechanisms: aggregation (of TCR-CD3 complexes), segregation (of inhibitory phosphatase CD45 from TCR-CD3), mechanosensing (TCR converts mechanical energy from T cell scanning of APCs into biochemical signal upon engaging pMHC), ligand-induced conformational change (allostery)
# The T cell receptor sequence influences the likelihood of T cell memory formation
## Abstract
 - **potential confounder for hydrophobicity:crossreactivity hypothesis, more hydrophobic CDR3s promotes regulatory T cell transcriptional states in CD4 and CD8 lineages**
 - **particular TCR amino acid sequences ~guarantee MAIT and NKT cell fates, other potential confounders**
## Introduction
 - **V(D)J gene usage known to influence transcriptional fate, *PLZF*<sup>high</sup> innate-like transcriptional fate ~guaranteed with *TRAV1-2* and *TRAJ33*, *TRAJ20*, or *TRAJ12***
## Discussion
 - **CDR3s more hydrophobic in KIR<sup>+</sup>*HELIOS*<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells, has been seen before, KIR<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells may be CD8 T<sub>regs</sub> and hydrophobic/aromatic junctional CDR3 residues may increase likelihood of self-reactivity and therefore Treg (CD4 *FOXP3* or CD8 KIR<sup>+</sup>*HELIOS*<sup>+</sup>) fate**
# The T cell repertoire in tumors overlaps with pulmonary inflammatory lesions in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors
 - **significant overlap between CDR3s of TRBs from tumor infiltrating T cell clones and clones infiltrating irAE lesions, most prevalent clones also expanded in peripheral blood but much less overlap**
# The yin and yang of co-inhibitory receptors: towards anti-tumor immunity without autoimmunity
 - co-inhibitory receptors: PD-1 (CD279), CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, CD152, high sequence similarity to co-stimulatory CD28 that it outcompetes for ligands B7-1/2), TIGIT (T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain, in CD28 protein family), TIM-3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing protein-3), LAG-3 (lymphocyte activation gene-3)
 - central tolerance in the thymus acts as the first control during T cell development to eliminate autoreactive clones
 - nuclear factor AIRE expressed in thymus facilitates ectopic expression of tissue-restricted antigens, helps negatively select autoreactive T cells (autoimmune phenotype in AIRE-deficient mice), but some autoreactive T cells escape negative selection (lack of self-tissue antigen expression in thymus, altered expression of self-antigens, low affinity expression of self-antigens) so peripheral regulation is key as well
 - T cell activation requires stimulation of TCR by MHC-peptide complex (signal 1) as well as co-stimulatory signal by co-stimulatory receptors (signal 2) with corresponding ligands on APCs
 - CD28 on T cells is a co-stimulatory receptor, ligand is B7-1/2 (on APCs), other co-stimulatory receptors include ICOS, CD226, OX-40, 4-1BB, GITR
 - in T<sub>regs</sub>, co-inhibitory receptors promote suppressive function
 - loss of IL-2 production and reduced proliferation occurs during early T cell exhaustion, late exhaustion characterized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells losing the ability to produce IFNγ and TNFα and degranulate
 - co-inhibitory receptors expressed in exhausted T cells
 - IFNγ-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th1) and IL-17-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th17 cells, differentiated by TGFβ and IL-6, expanded/maintained by IL-1/IL-23) implicated in autoimmunity, but not all Th17 cells are pathogenic (Th17 cells differentiated by TGF-β1 and IL-6 produce IL-17/10 and don't mediate inflammation, IL-23 differentiated Th17 cells are "pathogenic" and drive inflammation in autoimmunity and are similar to exhausted T cells)
 - **TH1 and TH17 are non-mutually exclusive cell fates: INFγ and IL-17 double positive cells reveal Th17 plasticity to IFNγ<sup>+</sup> Th1-like phenotype**
 - co-inhibitory receptors on T cells dampen T cell effector function (enhancing tumor progression but also preventing autoimmunity by reducing local/systemic inflammation, maintaining tissue tolerance)
 - IL-17A blocking antibodies used to treat some autoimmune diseases, drugs targeting proinflammatory TNFα also approved to treat some autoimmune diseases, but these aren't efficacious for all patients or all autoimmune diseases (there's a need for treatments affecting common critical points across diverse autoimmune diseases, **for example promoting T cell exhaustion by regulating the expression or function of checkpoint molecules**)
 - deletion of CTLA-4 in adult T cells leads to upregulation of inhibitory molecules (IL-10, LAG-3, PD-1)
 - in addition to the full length form of CTLA-4 (flCTLA-4, the transmembrane receptor), a soluble form exists (sCTLA-4) that lacks the transmembrane domain (exon 3) and is associated with T1D; there's also a splice variant of CTLA-4 that is ligand-independent (liCTLA-4, lacks B7-1/2 binding domain) and inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, **not sure why this ligand-independent CTLA-4 inhibits T cells**
 - CTLA-4 expressed on activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, T<sub>regs</sub> as well in cancer (anti-CTLA-4 treatment restoring exhausted T cell effector functions perhaps mainly due to depletion of T<sub>regs</sub>)
 - CTLA-4 levels usually anti-correlate with clinical outcome in cancer, but in non-small cell lung cancer high CTLA-4 expression in tumors actually predicts survival, **not sure of the mechanism for this inverted trend here**
 - PD-1 has two ligands: PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274, broadly expressed across tissue) and PD-L2 (B7-DC, CD273, only expressed on dendritic cells and some myeloid i.e. blood cells), PD-L1/2 expressed on various tumor cells
 - PD-1 expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells, monocytes, some dendritic cells
 - TIM-3 expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (more so on Th1 than Th17 cells, highly expressed by CD8<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> T cells which are a dysfunctional subset of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in tumors), NK cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes, ligands are galectin-9, phosphatidylserine, CEACAM1
 - TIM-3 OE on T cells leads to expansion of suppressor cells (old name for T<sub>regs</sub> **I think**), promotes tumor growth
 - TIGIT expressed on activated T cells, some T<sub>regs</sub>, T<sub>fh</sub> cells, and NK cells, ligands are CD155 (PVR) and CD112 (PVRL2) on APCs, T cells, tumor cells, and some non-hematopoietic cells; CD226 binds to same ligands as TIGIT, but is a co-stimulatory receptor (similar to B7:CD28:CTLA4)
 - LAG-3 expressed on activated T cells and some NK cells, binds to MHC-II with higher affinity than CD4, other ligands include LSECtin and FGL1 (fibrinogen-like protein 1)
 - T cell infiltration, particularly of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, into tumors is associated with better prognosis
 - CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can engage different differentiation pathways like Th1-type pathway that may have direct anti-tumor roles via secretion of INFγ or TNFα, but most notable effect of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is to help expand and differentiate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (which can then recognize and lyse tumor cells via granzyme B/perforin, FasL, TRAIL with the help of dendritic cells)
 - exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can't lyse tumor cells, have impaired effector functions (unable to produce effector cytokines like TNFα, IFNγ, IL-2), express co-inhibitory receptors
 - **possible sources of irAEs: aggravation of silent pre-existing autoimmune condition, neo-autoimmune or inflammatory disorder due to breakdown of self-tolerance, disruption of immune homeostasis in tissue (not sure exactly what this means), bystander self-tissue damage (on target, off tumor response), undesired reactions to checkpoint blockade (expression of co-inhibitory molecules on non-T cells for instance)**
 - **similarities between pathogenic, inflammation-driving Th17 (and Th1) cells and exhausted T cells could be exploited to treat cancer without inducing irAEs: PDPN expressed on Th17 cells and negatively regulates Th17 pathogenicity, PDPN also part of co-inhibitory gene module upregulated in cancer; PROCR also expressed in Th17 cells (also negatively regulates pathogenicity via repressing IL-1R) and exhausted T cells (PROCR deficiency inhibits tumor growth)**
 - another idea to limit irAEs from ICI is to treat the autoimmune side effects, for example with TNF blockade (which can even enhance ICI efficacy in targeting tumor beyond limiting irAEs, **not sure of mechanism here**)
# Thymus alterations and susceptibility to immune checkpoint inhibitor myocarditis
 - ICI treatment of thymic epithelial tumors more frequently associated with ICI myocarditis than other tumor types
 - ICI myocarditis more severe and occurs earlier in patients with thymic epithelial tumors vs. other cancer types
 - higher anti-acetylcholine antibody levels (proxy for thymic autoimmunity) in ICI myocarditis patients
 - tracks with association between thymic epithelial tumors and autoimmune diseases
 - hyperplastic thymus (oval shape and convex margin) associated with ICI myocardiits even pre-ICI
# TIGIT<sup>+</sup> NK cells in combination with specific gut microbiota features predict response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy in melanoma patients
 - TIGIT upregulated in T cells and CD56<sup>high</sup> NK cells of ICB responders
 - bacterial taxa associated with response (like *Ruminococcus torques*) or failure (like *Barnesiella intestinihominis*) to ICB
# TIGIT acts as an immune checkpoint upon inhibition of PD1 signaling in autoimmune diabetes
 - chronic activation of self-reactive T cells with beta cell antigens results in upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules that keep self-reactive T cells under control to delay beta cell destruction in autoimmune diabetes
 - inhibiting PD-(L)1 results in autoimmune diabetes in those with pre-existing autoimmunity against beta cells
 - TIGIT highly expressed on activated islet infiltrating T cells in NOD (non-obese diabetic) mice
 - they find subset of stem-like memory CD8s expressing TIGIT, PD1, and TF EOMES (linked to dysfunctional CD8s)
 - CD155 (TIGIT ligand) expressed on beta cells and islet infiltrating DCs, but islet infiltrating PD-1<sup>+</sup> TIGIT<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were still functional
 - inhibiting TIGIT in NOD mice didn't result in exacerbated autoimmune diabetes but inhibiting PD-(L)1 did
# TIGIT blockade reshapes the tumor microenvironment based on the single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis
 - mice
 - *TIGIT* mostly expressed on T, NK cells
 - TIGIT blockade inhibits Tregs by downregulating Foxp3, reducing secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, **could be similar mechanism for Tregs being up/relating to irAEs**
 - TIGIT blockade facilitates NK activation, stimulating CD8s
# Tissue-resident memory and circulating T cells are early responders to pre-surgical cancer immunotherapy
## Abstract
 - **treatment-responsive T cell clones recognize self-antigens including tumor antigens**
 - responding T cells in tumors display a tissue-resident memory program
 - circulating PD-1<sup>+</sup> KLRG1<sup>-</sup> CD8 T cell frequency correlates with response
 - tumor infiltrating CD8 T cells expanded during ICB expressed elevated tissue-resident memory and cytotoxicity programs
 - expanded T cells in ICB recognized self-antigens like cancer-speciifc MAGEA1
## Discussion
 - previous literature: inhibitory receptors constitutively expressed by tissue-resident T cells
# Tissue-resident memory T cells in immune-related adverse events: friend or foe?
 - **previous literature: T<sub>RM</sub> cells locally expanded in irAE-dermatitis and -colitis**
 - T<sub>RM</sub> cells remain in tissue through expression of retention molecules (CD103, CD69 or CD49a), express PD-1 and other inhibitory receptors that control reactivation
 - T<sub>RM</sub> cells particularly abundant in barrier organs (skin, GI tract), perhaps due to abundant microbial antigens in barriers
 - perhaps ICB reinvigorates T<sub>RM</sub> cells
 - **systemic corticosteroids used to treat irAEs, or systemic JAKi (both suppress T cell function globally), but homing integrins like ITGA4 are upregulated in irAEs and has been targeted to treat irAEs**
# Toxicity-specific peripheral blood T and B cell dynamics in anti-PD-1 and combined immune checkpoint inhibition
## Abstract
 - flow cytometry
 - irAEs after ICI characterized by enhanced proliferation of Th1-associated (mainly CD4<sup>+</sup>) CD27<sup>-</sup> effector memory T cells, also Th17-associated immune responses and germinal center activation (CXCL13 and IL-21 increases)
 - see no changes in CD21<sup>low</sup>, memory, class-switched, or newly activated B cell subsets
 - PD-1<sup>+</sup>LAG-3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show enhanced cytotoxic capacity in patients with irAEs after ICI
 - irAEs from PD-1 associated with enhanced Th1-associated responses (increased serum CXCL9/10)
 - **growing body of evidence that irAEs are driven by newly activated CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells**
## Introduction
 - irAEs should be considered separate from autoimmune disease, more acute onset and possibility of complete reversibility with adequate therapy
 - biomarkers of irAE development: higher baseline blood lymphocyte count, proliferation of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets (particularly effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells), baseline Th17 dominance, early increase in CD21<sup>low</sup> B cells
 - role for T cell autoreactivity in irAE development (CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clonal expansion preceeding irAEs and epitope sharing between tumor and irAE-affected tissue)
## Results
### CD27<sup>-</sup> CD4<sub>EM</sub> T cell proliferation is strongly associated with irAEs in combined ICI
### Th1- and Th17-associated immune responses primarily delineate irAEs after combined ICI, while anti-PD-1 TOX features only a modest Th1-associated response
## Discussion
 - helper T cells may provide help to autoantibody-producing B cells
# Transcript-indexed ATAC-seq for precision immune profiling
 - they just mean TCRseq + ATAC-seq by transcript-indexed ATAC-seq
# Transcriptional programs of neoantigen-specific TIL in anti-PD-1-treated lung cancers
## Abstract
 - previous literature: majority of TILs don't recognize tumor antigens (bystander T cells)
 - here, they find neoantigen and viral specific TILs with unique transcriptional programs
 - neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells have transcriptional programs of Trm cells but have low levels of IL-7R, less responsive to IL-7 compared to flu-specific Trm cells
 - neoantigen-specific clones from non-responding tumors express TCRs with lower ligand-dependent signaling
## Discussion
 - one hypothesis for the lack of ICB response in some patients is that tumour-specific T cells exhibit low activity owing to poor avidity or affinity of their TCR for its cognate peptide MHC, **not sure what this means exactly**
# Transcriptomic profiling of human effector and regulatory T cell subsets identifies predictive population signatures
 - Tregs less transcriptionally diverse than Th cells, likely reflects dominant role of Foxp3 on Treg transcriptome
 - most Tregs develop in thymus upon encountering self-antigen, some Tregs may also develop at barrier sites upon encountering harmless environmental antigens (like skin/intestinal microbiome components)
# Treg heterogeneity, function, and homeostasis
 - Tregs ensure tolerance to autoantigens, antigens of commensal microflora, limit excess immune responses, induce tolerance to food antigens
 - IL-10 and TGF-β are primary suppressive cytokines
 - IL-2 and its receptor CD25 are important for developing and maintaing Tregs
 - FoxP3 is main Treg transcription factor, associated with high CD25 expression
 - Tregs defined as CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>
 - Tregs can develop in thymus (tTregs, express FoxP3, high autoaffinity TCR, provide tolerance to autoantigens) or peripherally (pTregs, prevent local inflammation in presence of exogenous antigens) from effector cells
# tRNA-m<sup>1</sup>A modification promotes T cell expansion via efficient MYC protein synthesis
 - naive T cells undergo radical changes during transition from dormant to hyperactive state, necesitating *de novo* transcription and translation
 - here, they propose mechanism for enhanced translation efficiency to promote this transition
# Tumor immunotherapies by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs); the pros and cons
 - CTLA-4 acts at earlier stage of T cell induction, PD-(L)1 acts at later stage to prevent T cell function in peripheral tissue
# Tumor invasion in the central airway is a risk factor for early-onset checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
 - pneumonitis irAE that develops earlier is more severe
 - tumor invasion into central airway may be a source of inflammation, contributing to pneumonitis
 - patients with tumor invasion into central airway may have higher levels of systemic inflamamtion
# Tumor-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells enter a TCF1<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>-</sup> dysfunctional state
 - self/shared antigens (SSA): tumor antigens aberrantly expressed but not mutated i.e. shared with normal tissue
 - tumor-specific antigens: mutated proteins or oncogenic viral proteins
 - genetic cancer mouse model in which they can track tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and self/shared antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation longitudinally as liver cancers develop
 - find that both tumor and self/shared antigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells lost effector function over time but in different ways: **tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells persist long term but are dysfunctional/exhausted (PD-1<sup>+</sup>, CD39<sup>+</sup>, TOX<sup>+</sup>) while self/shared antigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exit cell cycle prematurely and disappear from liver lesions but persist in spleen in dysfunctional TCF1<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>-</sup> state unable to produce effector cytokines or proliferate in response to PD-1 blockade**
# Tumor resident memory CD8 T cells and concomitant tumor immunity develop independently of CD4 help
 - immune systems applies a form of 2FA: both CD4 and CD8 T cells need to recognize distinct antigen epitopes in same pathogen, signal integration at level of DC in draining lymph nodes (CD4 T cells license DCs to optimally generate Tcm CD8 T cells to cross presented antigen)
 - Trm: alternative population of memory CD8 T cells that remain in tissue/tumor
# Tutorial: guidelines for annotating single cell transcriptomic maps using automated and manual methods
 - Seurat reference method is reference-based automatic annotation
# Type 1/type 2 immunity in infectious diseases
 - Th1 (T helper type 1) cells secrete IL-2, interferon-γ, lymphotoxin-α and stimulate type 1 immunity (intense phagocytic activity), more or less synonymous with cell-mediated immunity but some antibodies are still produced, protective for most infections
 - Th2 cells secrete IL-4/5/9/10/13 and stimulate type 2 immunity (high antibody titers), more or less synonymous with humoral immunity (Th2 cells suppress phagocytosis), resolves cell-mediated inflammation
 - systemic stress, immunosuppression cause type 2 response to infection normally controlled by type 1 response
# Uncoupling therapeutic efficacy from immune-related adverse events in immune checkpoint blockade
## Improving immunotherapeutic strategies to reduce irAEs
### Broadening checkpoint blockade antibody strategies
 - perhaps try dual immunodulatory antibodies (bispecific or antibody-based alternative structures), for example targeting PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with LAG-3/TIM-3 (perhaps promotes retention in tumor microenvironment over healthy tissue)
 - perhaps modify anti-CTLA-4 antibodies to permit expression of CTLA-4 on Tregs (CTLA-4 required for Treg inhibitory function)
# Understanding subset diversity in T cell memory
 - TCM/TEM more similar than either with Trm, at least with respect to location (i.e. TEMs/TCMs not in tissue like Trms are)
 - TCMs traffick through lymphoid tissue, TEMs through non-lymphoid tissue/blood
# Unique features of the TCR repertoire of reactivated memory T cells in the experimental mouse tumor model
## Abstract
 - **after cognate antigen reencounter, memory T cells enriched with clonotypes that express α chain TCRs with high potential crossreactivity (more hydrophobic) and enhanced strength of interaction with pMHC**
 - no changes observed in TCR β characteristics of reactivated memory clonotypes
## Discussion
 - **CDR3 of re-stimulated TCRα memory clonotypes became rich in hydrophobic, strongly interacting, bulky residues (see same trend in middle 5 residues), perhaps associated with crossreactivity**
 - **takehome: perhaps high crossreactivity in re-stimulated memory clonotypes means higher efficiency of clones capable of recognizing multiple (tumor) peptide antigens and emergent mutants, could c ontrol tumors with high mutation rates better**
# Unraveling age-specific complexity in the human T cell compartment
 - TEA-seq to investigste transcriptomics, epitopes, and chromatin accessibility of single cells
 - compare children and older adult immune profiles
 - CD8αα T cells in children lost in older adults
# Unveiling immune checkpoint regulation: exploring the power of *in vivo* CRISPR screenings in cancer immunotherapy
 - many genetic variants are "passenger gene alterations" that don't harbor any functional significance but can elicit immunoediting when presented as neoepitopes
 - method: transduce cancer cells into mice, analyze sgRNA abundance in surviving tumors via deep sequencing
# Updates in the pathogenesis and management of immune-related enterocolitis, hepatitis, and cardiovascular toxicities
 - pathophysiology of irAEs distinct from autoimmune conditions
 - surprisingly, given fear of immune modulation to treat irAEs reducing antitumor response (like corticosteroids inducing apoptosis of proliferating T cells), some immunomodulatory agents might help antitumor response (like TNFα inhibition that may help prevent TIL death)
## Colitis
 - distinct from IBD
 - activated memory CD8 T cells, MAITs associated with ICI colitis and not with UC
 - Trms increased following ICI, less pronounced in IBD
## Hepatits
 - CD8 CTLs in periphery and liver microenvironment with increased granzyme/perforin expression associated with hepatitis
 - clonal expansion of Th1 and Th17 CD4s
 - suppression of Tregs
 - liver uniquely has high antigen load (portal circulation), relies on immune tolerance maintenance
## Myocarditis
 - clonal expansion of autoreactive CD8s specific for α-myosin in skeletal/cardiac muscle
# Urinary T cells are detected in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated immune nephritis that are clonotypically identical to kidney T cell infiltrates
 - acute kidney injury in ~20% of ICI patients
 - 2-5% ICI patients develop irAE nephritis
 - urinary immune cells correlate with kidney pathology in other autoimmune renal diseases
 - detect T cells in urine in patients with irAE nephritis (flow cytometry)
 - TCR analysis: enrichment of kidney TCRs in urine
# Using surface hydrophobicity together with empirical potentials to identify protein-protein binding sites. Application to the interactions of E-cadherins
 - **not sure why yet and surprising to me, but apparently hydrophobic interactions are generally the strongest for protein binding BUT don't necessarily provide specificity that comes from other residues**
 - **idea is that hydrophobic residues provide affinity and polar/charged ones provide specificity via a more limited set of specific favorable structures**
 - **takehome for me is that yes hydrophobicity should correlate with crossreactivity as more possible favorable structures are likely with higher hydrophobicity**
# V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination of immunoglobulins: mechanism and regulation
## Summary
 - V, D, J segments exist as multiple copy arrays on chromosome
 - V(D)J recombination can include deleting or inverting of intervening DNA between V, D, J segments and ligation
## Immunoglobulin structure and genetic encoding
 - immunoglobulin: 2 heavy chains (IgH) and 2 light chains (IgL, encoded by IgK and IgL genes)
 - IgH chains ahve 4 or 5 domains, IgL have 2 domains
 - IgH chains have 5 major isotypes: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, IgE, 4 subtypes of IgG and 2 subtypes of IgA
# Utility of T cell immunosequencing in distinguishing mycosis fungoides progression from treatment related cutaneous adverse events
 - case report of monitoring malignant T cell frequency
# Virus-specific memory T cell responses unmasked by immune checkpoint blockade cause hepatitis
## Abstract
 - identify subset of melanoma patients predisposed to ICB-related hepatitis distinguished by chronic expansion of effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (T<sub>EM</sub> cells)
 - pre-therapy CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cell expansion in patients with metastatic disease and high CMV-specific serum antibody titers
 - CMV reactivation as cause of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> expansion
 - pre-therapy CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> expansion predicts hepatitis in CMV-seropositive patients
## Introduction
 - **irAEs different from autoimmune diseases**
 - irAEs attributed to dysregulated T cells, autoantibodies, here they propose also pathogen-specific memory T cells
 - CMV seroprevalence is high (at least among Europeans), blood cells are major reservoir for CMV (latent)
 - CMV reactivation follows immune compromise by immunosuppressive therapy or other viral infections, reactivation can present as colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, encephalitis (**some irAEs might just be CMV reactivation from ICB??**) through viral replication and T cell immunity (overreaction of inflammation to low level viral replication)
 - cycles of CMV latency and reactivation lead to phenomenon of memory inflation: failure of primed CMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to contract and give rise to central memory T cells (instead maintain a dominant pool of effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that doesn't become exhausted)
## Results
### Clinical features do not predict αPD-1/αCTLA-4 related hepatitis
 - don't observe associations/coinciding of different irAEs (hepatitis, colitis, thyroiditis) in same patients, so **perhaps some individuals are predisposed to particular irAEs**
 - hepatitis irAE associated with younger age and less rounds of ICB (**surprising**), no association with liver function markers, tumor burden, hepatitis B/C/E virus seropositivity, or autoimmune hepatitis-related autoantibodies
### CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cell expansion predicts αPD-1/αCTLA-4 related hepatitis
 - pre-ICB: see over-representation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells associated with hepatitis, baseline expansion of these cells predicts hepatitis irAE (and not colitis, thyroiditis, or clinical response to ICB)
### Opting for αPD-1 monotherapy reduces risk of hepatitis
 - not surprising, less irAEs than combination ICB
### CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> frequency is an independent predictor of hepatitis
 - want to investigate causes of baseline CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> expansion, find liver inflammation as a common cause
### CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cell expansion is associated with chronic T cell activation
 - higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> patients had more exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD160<sup>+</sup> CD244<sup>+</sup>)
 - these higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> patients aren't generally immunocompromised despite chronically activated and exhausted T cells (no differences in Torque Teno Virus load)
### CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cell expansion correlates with immunity to CMV
 - see association between CMV-specific IgG antibody levels and T cell reactivity against CMV peptides and CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> status
### CMV-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are enriched in CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub><sup>high</sup> patients
### Valganciclovir reverses αPD-1/αCTLA-4 related hepatitis
 - anti-viral therapy with valganciclovir (anti-CMV) reverses hepatitis irAE
### Valganciclovir prophylaxis prevents αPD-1/αCTLA-4-related hepatitis
## Discussion
 - model: metastatic disease promotes compartmentalised CMV reactivation in latently infected individuals, possibly triggered by an unknown winter virus infection; in turn, CMV stimulates expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells prior to immunotherapy. When αPD-1/αCTLA-4 therapy is given, these T<sub>EM</sub> cells might inflict liver injury directly or promote bystander T cell responses
 - **anti-viral immunity might also explain predisposition to other adverse reactions following αPD-1/αCTLA-4 therapy, such as colitis or pneumonitis**
# Vitiligo-specific soluble biomarkers as early indicators of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic melanoma patients
## Abstract
 - basal CD25 serum levels were higher in stable and responding patients and remained higher during the first 3 months of CPI therapy compared to non-responders
 - CXCL9 was absent in non-responding patients before therapy
 - increase of CXCL9 levels was observed at 1 and 3 months of therapy for all patients, although higher CXCL9 amounts were present in stable and responding compared to non-responding patients
 - reduced number of regulatory T lymphocytes in responding patients
# Whole-body CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell visualization before and during cancer immunotherapy: a phase 1/2 trial
 - heterogeneity in CD8 T cell distribution within/between patients
 - higher TIL associated with better response to ICB
# Why must T cells be cross-reactive?
 - TCR repertoire dwarfed by potential foreign antigens
 - > 7,000 allelic variants of HLA locus in human population
 - each person expresses 6 different HLA class I molecules (2 HLA-A, 2 HLA-B, 2 HLA-C) and 6 HLA class II molecules (HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP)
 - memory T cells can recognize lower concentrations of antigen than naive T cells (> 50 fold lower), perhaps via changes in TCR expression levels, TCR clustering on cell surface, changes in expression of costimulatory molecules, control of T cell signaling, or alterations in TCR glycosylation
 - heterologous immunity: individual T cell clone can target > 1 infection through different peptides, common between related pathogens (i.e. immunity to cowpox protects against smallpox), different peptides can be dissimilar in sequence
 - connection to autoimmunity: weakly autoreactive T cells can escape negative selection in thymus and be activated through crossrecognition of foreign antigens (molecular mimicry)
 - **since memory T cells can be stimulated by peptide concentrations > 50 fold lower than those required to stimulate naive T cells, more likely for memory T cell to be stimulated by crossreactive peptide, pathogen-mediated priming would be required first before crossreactivity (i.e. naive T cell that lead to generation of memory T cell stimulated by pathogen first), this is consistent with infection precipitating autoimmunity**
 - **any given TCR-pMHC interaction is likely not the best TCR to bind that pMHC (affinity wise), but it's good enough to stimulate a response, this also means that the affinity can be increased for therapeutics**
# γδ T cell exhaustion: Opportunities for intervention
 - γδ T cells (TCRs with γ and δ chains instead of the usual α and β ones) can respond to varied infections/tumor challenges in a non-MHC-restricted manner, involved in immune surveillance (pleiotropic i.e. more than one effector functions)
