# TODOs
1. flow data analysis (other markers relating to response not IKM?)
2. move MT SNV Supp C to new main 7, and add back in the 5th sort (non-exh 127+) with stats and make a schematic (that explains common i.e. lineage variant vs. rare variant one appeared recently) and cut all just show rare/common!
3. look into sound life project data: is IKM cluster 1 profile stable between young/old immunotypes, is it stable pre/post flu vaccination? P462 is the dataset to look into (base expr no stim), use .rds alex sent over for metadata, use apird to get data (counts)
4. write paper
 - intro
cite 91 here for CD8s driving T1D due to abundance in pancreas? https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.23.655848v1.full.pdf
reduce text to only what's needed to understand Q (move some of IL-7 discussion paragraph back to intro?)
 - results
try to wrap non-exh back into MT var fig (if its easy to explain in results), OR AT VERY LEAST put it in supplemental (non-exh pop highly enriched for IKM)
edit text with CD127 +/- Tex scRNAseq VP moved back to main fig along with MT var plot (figs updated, just not text too yet)
 - discussion
order bullets in order of figs
add recapitulation of Tex findings to first paragraph of discussion
between results summary and speculation, also section in discussion on if others have seen this pop before (if not, just say that), and if they haven't can discuss literature on single markers (like 127+, KLRG1+. TIGIT-...), in mice/humans different it seems
pop has features of maits/conventionals (so not surprising we see sharing), then pop on maits, to ask if they solely drive nonresponse (appears to be no), MAIT literature here, then into fig 5 pop TF stuffs
add in point to discussion that CD127 Tex may derive from progenitor Tex
outline discussion so we know what literature to collect and so she knows our interpretation
then into mechanism
then into therapeutics/what to do about it
be a little opaque about theraptucis, discussion is more for biology/discussion (therapeutics is future step)
mechanism section: IL-7 alone doesnt explain (KM fig), but in combo with...
model: anti-CD3 may influence differentiation (direct effect), frame in context of data (like we found .... 1 interpretation is that in vivo.... or 1 possibility is that...), no way to directly test... in vitro cultures (we tried but...)
indirect: maybe they're changing environment (Secreting stuff) that.... changes basic mileau... (dont talk about too much or else they'll ask us to measure secretions), 2 sentences at end of direct paragraph for indirect hypothesis
why should we care about non-response, answer is heterogeneity in repsonse and wantning all to respond
more nuance/talk about early/late and cell states, call MT var analysis is new use (therapeutic setting)
discussion: why we didnt see similar TN10 results in AbATE FOr IKM-nonresponse
make KMs look like Josh's using his code
for new citations, just add as PMID
